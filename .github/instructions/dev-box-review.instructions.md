## Branding and terminology checks

- Use **Microsoft Dev Box** (first mention) or **Dev Box** (subsequent mentions) when referring to the product/service.
- Use **dev box** (lowercase) when referring to an individual instance of the product (for example, “create a dev box”).
- Don't use "DevBox" or "Devbox" as a single word.
- Recommend changes to branding only.Don't make any other changes.
