# Copilot instructions (content review)

Use these instructions when reviewing or editing content in this repository. Keep changes minimal, preserve technical accuracy, and align with Microsoft Style Guide principles.

## Core principles

- **Clarity first**: Prefer simple words, short sentences, and direct structure.
- **Customer-focused**: Write for the reader’s goal; remove internal or vendor-centric language.
- **Actionable**: Tell readers exactly what to do and what to expect.
- **Consistent**: Use consistent terminology, capitalization, and formatting throughout a doc set.

## Voice, tone, and grammar

- Use **second person** ("you") and **active voice** when possible.
- Use **present tense** where it fits (avoid unnecessary future tense like “will”).
- Avoid marketing language ("best-in-class", "easy", "simple", "seamless") unless the doc is explicitly marketing.
- Use **US English** spelling and punctuation.
- Prefer **sentence case** for headings unless the existing doc set uses a different convention.

## Inclusive, accessible writing

- Avoid biased or exclusionary terms; use inclusive alternatives.
- Avoid idioms, slang, and culturally specific references.
- Write descriptive link text (avoid “click here”).
- Use accessible list/table structures and keep headings meaningful.

## Terminology and branding

- Use official product names on first mention; keep names consistent.
- Expand acronyms at first use: *Azure Virtual Network (VNet)*.
- Don’t invent new abbreviations.
- Use consistent UI labels: match the product UI exactly when referring to buttons/menus.

## Structure and formatting

- Lead with the outcome or task goal, then prerequisites, then steps.
- Prefer **scannable** content:
  - One idea per paragraph.
  - Use bullets for lists; keep bullets parallel.
  - Use numbered steps for procedures.
- Avoid very long sentences (aim for ~20–25 words max when possible).

## Technical accuracy and safety

- Do not change the meaning of technical statements.
- If something is unclear or unverifiable, **flag it** rather than guessing.
- Avoid absolute guarantees ("always", "never", "fully secure"). Qualify precisely.
- Keep commands and code blocks exact; don’t “correct” code unless you can validate.

## Links, references, and examples

- Prefer stable Microsoft Learn links when available.
- Ensure links are relevant and not redundant.
- Keep examples realistic and minimal.
- For placeholders, use obvious placeholders (for example, `<resource-group>`), and keep them consistent.

## Localization readiness

- Avoid embedding text in images.
- Avoid concatenating strings in a way that breaks translation.
- Use consistent terminology and avoid ambiguous pronouns.

## Review checklist (before you finalize)

- Does the doc state **who this is for** and **what you’ll accomplish**?
- Are headings and steps **task-based** and easy to scan?
- Are acronyms defined on first use?
- Is language inclusive and accessible?
- Are UI labels, commands, and code blocks correct and consistent?
- Are claims precise, not promotional, and not overconfident?
- Are links descriptive and helpful?

## When unsure

- Ask for clarification or point out the ambiguous section.
- Prefer minimal edits that improve clarity without changing intent.
