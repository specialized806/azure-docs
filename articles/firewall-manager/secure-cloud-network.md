# Tutorial: Secure your virtual hub using Azure Firewall Manager

Using Azure Firewall Manager, you can create secured virtual hubs to secure your cloud network traffic destined to private IP addresses, Azure PaaS, and the Internet. Traffic routing to the firewall is automated, so there's no need to create user-defined routes (UDRs).

Firewall Manager also supports a hub virtual network architecture. For a comparison of the secured virtual hub and hub virtual network architecture types, see [What are the Azure Firewall Manager architecture options?](vhubs-and-vnets.md)

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create the spoke virtual network
> * Create a secured virtual hub
> * Connect the hub and spoke virtual networks
> * Route traffic to your hub
> * Deploy the servers
> * Create a firewall policy and secure your hub
> * Test the firewall

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The procedure in this tutorial uses Azure Firewall Manager to create a new Azure Virtual WAN secured hub.
> You can use Firewall Manager to upgrade an existing hub, but you can't configure Azure **Availability Zones** for Azure Firewall.
> It's also possible to convert an existing hub to a secured hub using the Azure portal, as described in [Configure Azure Firewall in a Virtual WAN hub](../virtual-wan/howto-firewall.md). But like Azure Firewall Manager, you can't configure **Availability Zones**.
> To upgrade an existing hub and specify Availability Zones for Azure Firewall (recommended), you must follow the upgrade procedure in [Tutorial: Secure your virtual hub using Azure PowerShell](secure-cloud-network-powershell.md).

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn) before you begin.

## Create a hub and spoke architecture

First, create spoke virtual networks where you can place your servers.

### Create two spoke virtual networks and subnets

The two virtual networks each have a workload server in them and are protected by the firewall.

1. From the Azure portal home page, select **Create a resource**.
1. Search for **Virtual network**, select it, and select **Create**.
1. Create a virtual network with the following settings:

    | Setting               | Value                        |
    |-----------------------|------------------------------|
    | Subscription          | Select your subscription     |
    | Resource group        | Select **Create new**, and type **fw-manager-rg** for the name and select **OK** |
    | Virtual network name  | **Spoke-01**                 |
    | Region                | **East US**                  |


1. Select **Next**, then select **Next**.
1. In the **Networking** tab, create subnets with the following settings:

    | Setting                  | Value                |
    |--------------------------|----------------------|
    | Add IPv4 address space   | 10.0.0.0/16 (default)|
    | Subnets                  |                      |
    | **Workload subnet**      |                      |
    | Name                     | Workload-01-SN       |
    | Starting address         | 10.0.1.0/24          |
    | **Bastion subnet**       |                      |
    | Name                     | AzureBastionSubnet   |
    | Starting address         | 10.0.2.0/26          |
    


1. Select **Save**, **Review + create**, then select **Create**.

Repeat this procedure to create another similar virtual network in the **fw-manager-rg** resource group:

| Setting               | Value                |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Name                  | **Spoke-02**         |
| Address space         | **10.1.0.0/16**      |
| Subnet name           | **Workload-02-SN**   |
| Starting address      | **10.1.1.0/24**      |

### Create the secured virtual hub

Create your secured virtual hub using Firewall Manager.

1. From the Azure portal home page, select **All services**.
1. In the search box, type **Firewall Manager** and select **Firewall Manager**.
1. On the **Firewall Manager** page under **Deployments**, select **Virtual hubs**.
1. On the **Firewall Manager | Virtual hubs** page, select **Create new secured virtual hub**.
1. On the **Create new secured virtual hub** page, enter the following information:

    | Setting                | Value                |
    |------------------------|----------------------|
    | Subscription           | Select your subscription. |
    | Resource group         | Select **fw-manager-rg** |
    | Region                 | **East US**          |
    | Secured virtual hub name | **Hub-01**          |
    | Hub address space      | **10.2.0.0/16**      |

1. Select **New vWAN**.

    | Setting                                         | Value                                      |
    |-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
    | New virtual WAN name                            | **Vwan-01**                                |
    | Type                                            | **Standard**                               |
    | Include VPN gateway to enable Trusted Security Partners | Leave the check box cleared.                |

1. Select **Next: Azure Firewall**.
1. Accept the default **Azure Firewall** **Enabled** setting.
1. For **Azure Firewall tier**, select **Standard**.
1. Select the desired combination of **Availability Zones**. 

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > A Virtual WAN is a collection of hubs and services made available inside the hub. You can deploy as many Virtual WANs as you need. In a Virtual WAN hub, there are multiple services like VPN, ExpressRoute, and so on. Each of these services is automatically deployed across Availability Zones except Azure Firewall, if the region supports Availability Zones. To align with Azure Virtual WAN resiliency, you should select all available Availability Zones.


1. Type **1** in the **Specify number of Public IP addresses** text box or associate an existing public IP address (preview) with this firewall.
1. Under **Firewall Policy** ensure the **Default Deny Policy** is selected. You refine your settings later in this article.
1. Select **Next: Security Partner Provider**.
1. Accept the default **Trusted Security Partner** **Disabled** setting, and select **Next: Review + create**.
1. Select **Create**. 

> [!NOTE]
> It may take up to 30 minutes to create a secured virtual hub.

You can find the firewall public IP address after the deployment completes.

1. Open **Firewall Manager**.
1. Select **Virtual hubs**.
1. Select **hub-01**.
1. Select **AzureFirewall_Hub-01**.
1. Note the public IP address to use later.

### Connect the hub and spoke virtual networks

Now you can peer the hub and spoke virtual networks.

1. Select the **fw-manager-rg** resource group, then select the **Vwan-01** virtual WAN.
1. Under **Connectivity**, select **Virtual network connections**.

    | Setting           | Value                |
    |-------------------|----------------------|
    | Connection name   | **hub-spoke-01**     |
    | Hubs              | **Hub-01**           |
    | Resource group    | **fw-manager-rg**    |
    | Virtual network   | **Spoke-01**         |

1. Select **Create**.
1. Repeat the previous steps to connect the **Spoke-02** virtual network with the following settings:

    | Setting           | Value                |
    |-------------------|----------------------|
    | Connection name   | **hub-spoke-02**     |
    | Hubs              | **Hub-01**           |
    | Resource group    | **fw-manager-rg**    |
    | Virtual network   | **Spoke-02**         |

## Deploy the servers

1. Select **Review + create**, then select **Create**.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Bastion deployment can take approximately 10 minutes to complete.

## Create a firewall policy and secure your hub

A firewall policy defines collections of rules to direct traffic on one or more Secured virtual hubs. You create your firewall policy and then secure your hub.

1. From Firewall Manager, select **Azure Firewall policies**.
1. Select **Create Azure Firewall Policy**.
1. For **Resource group**, select **fw-manager-rg**.
1. Under **Policy details**, for the **Name** type **Policy-01** and for **Region** select **East US**.
1. For **Policy tier**, select **Standard**.
1. Select **Next: DNS Settings**.
1. Select **Next: TLS Inspection**.
1. Select **Next : Rules**.
1. On the **Rules** tab, select **Add a rule collection**.
1. On the **Add a rule collection** page, enter the following information.

    | Setting                | Value                  |
    |------------------------|------------------------|
    | Name                   | **App-RC-01**          |
    | Rule collection type   | **Application**        |

1. Select **Add**, then select **Next: IDPS**.

1. On the **IDPS** page, select **Next: Threat Intelligence**

1. In the **Threat Intelligence** page, accept defaults and select **Review and Create**:

  1. Review to confirm your selection and then select **Create**.

## Associate policy

Associate the firewall policy with the hub.

1. From Firewall Manager, select **Azure Firewall Policies**.
1. Select the check box for **Policy-01**.
1. Select **Manage associations**, **Associate hubs**.
1. Select **hub-01**.
1. Select **Add**.

## Route traffic to your hub

Now you must ensure that network traffic gets routed through your firewall.

1. From Firewall Manager, select **Virtual hubs**.
1. Select **Hub-01**.
1. Under **Settings**, select **Security configuration**.
1. Under **Internet traffic**, select **Azure Firewall**.
1. Under **Private traffic**, select **Send via Azure Firewall**.
   > [!NOTE]
   > If you're using public IP address ranges for private networks in a virtual network or an on-premises branch, you need to explicitly specify these IP address prefixes. Select the **Private Traffic Prefixes** section and then add them alongside the RFC1918 address prefixes.
1. Under **Inter-hub**, select **Enabled** to enable the Virtual WAN routing intent feature. Routing intent is the mechanism through which you can configure Virtual WAN to route branch-to-branch (on-premises to on-premises) traffic via Azure Firewall deployed in the Virtual WAN Hub. For more information regarding prerequisites and considerations associated with the routing intent feature, see [Routing Intent documentation](../virtual-wan/how-to-routing-policies.md). 
1. Select **Save**.
1. Select **OK** on the **Warning** dialog.
1. Select **OK** on the **Migrate to use inter-hub** dialog.

   > [!NOTE]
   > It takes a few minutes to update the route tables.

1. Verify that the two connections show Azure Firewall secures both Internet and private traffic.

## Test the firewall

To test the firewall rules, use Azure Bastion to connect to **Srv-Workload-01** and verify both the application and network rules are working.

### Test the application rule

Now, test the firewall rules to confirm that it works as expected.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Srv-workload-01** virtual machine.
1. Select **Connect** > **Connect via Bastion**.
1. Provide the username **azureuser** and upload the private key `.pem` file that you downloaded when you created the VM.
1. Select **Connect** to open an SSH session.

1. In the SSH session, run the following command to test access to Microsoft:

   ```bash
   curl https://www.microsoft.com
   ```

   You should see HTML content returned, confirming access is allowed.

1. Test access to Google (which should be blocked):

   ```bash
   curl https://www.google.com
   ```

   The request should timeout or fail, showing the firewall is blocking this site.

So now you verified that the firewall application rule is working:

* You can browse to the one allowed FQDN, but not to any others.

### Test the network rule

Now test the network rule by connecting from **Srv-Workload-01** to **Srv-Workload-02** using SSH and HTTP.

1. From the SSH session on **Srv-Workload-01**, note the private IP address of **Srv-Workload-02** (visible in the Azure portal under the VM's networking settings).

1. Test SSH connectivity to **Srv-Workload-02**:

   ```bash
   ssh azureuser@<Srv-Workload-02-private-IP>
   ```

   Type `yes` to accept the host key, then enter the connection. You may need to upload the private key for Srv-Workload-02 if using key-based authentication.

1. Exit the SSH session to Srv-Workload-02:

   ```bash
   exit
   ```

1. Test HTTP connectivity to the Nginx web server on **Srv-Workload-02**:

   ```bash
   curl http://<Srv-Workload-02-private-IP>
   ```

   You should see the HTML content `<h1>Srv-workload-02</h1>`, confirming the network rule allows HTTP traffic between spokes.

So now you verified that the firewall network rule is working:
* You can connect a remote desktop to a server located in another virtual network.

## Clean up resources

When you’re done testing your firewall resources, delete the **fw-manager-rg** resource group to delete all firewall-related resources.
