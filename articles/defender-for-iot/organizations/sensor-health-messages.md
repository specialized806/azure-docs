# Sensor health message reference

This article lists the sensor health messages displayed in the **Sites and sensors** page in the Azure portal.

For more information, see [Understand sensor health](how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud.md#understand-sensor-health).

## Critical messages

|Title  |Message  |Recommendation  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Disconnected**     |   This sensor isn't communicating with Azure     |   Try signing into the sensor to check for errors or networking failures. <br><br> We also recommend reviewing the sensor networking configuration and verifying the sensor’s ability to communicate with Azure.      |
|**Sanity failed**     |    This sensor failed an internal consistency check     |       The sensor is in a degraded state. <br><br> Check the sensor for hardware failures and try restarting the sensor.  If the issue isn't resolved, open a support ticket.  |
|**No traffic detected**     |   No traffic detected on the monitored network interfaces      |  Check that the monitoring ports are connected to SPAN/monitor ports on the adjacent switch and that traffic is active on the link. At least one link with network traffic should be connected to the monitor ports.       |
|**No connection to NTP** |Failed to connect to the NTP server. |Contact your network team to confirm that the NTP server is reachable, or replace the NTP server with an accessible alternative. |
|**No connection to active directory** |Failed to connect to any of the following Active Directory servers. |Check with you network team if the Domain Controller server is reachable. |
|**Traffic bandwidth exceeded its limit** |The sensor exceeded its network bandwidth limit. The current bandwidth is <<current_bandwidth>>, which exceeds the maximum supported limit of <<max_bandwidth>>. |Connect the sensor to a more accurate switch location or purchase a sensor with enhanced hardware specifications. |
|**Number of monitored devices exceeded its limit** |The sensor exceeded its monitored devices limit. The current number of monitored devices is <<current_devices>>, which exceeds the maximum supported limit of <<max_devices>>. |Connect the sensor to a more accurate switch location or purchase a sensor with enhanced hardware specifications.|

## Warning messages

|Title  |Message  |Recommendation  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Package upload failed** |There was an error uploading the file to the sensor |Verify the sensor’s ability to communicate with download.microsoft.com and retry. <br><br> If the problem persists,  open a support ticket.|
|**Sensor update failed** | There was an error installing the update.| Open a support ticket. |
| **Unstable traffic to Azure**|Sensor’s connection to Azure is unstable | We recommend that you check the sensor WAN connection, the BW limit settings, and validate network equipment that might be on the route between the sensor and the cloud.|
| **Outdated**|Outdated software may result in a non-optimal experience | Upgrade your sensor software to the latest version to use the most recently available Defender for IoT features.|
| **NTP server not configured**|No NTP server is configured on the sensor | For accurate time synchronization, configure an NTP server in the **Sensor settings** page.|
| **Traffic bandwidth is close to its limit** |The sensor is close to exceeding its network traffic bandwidth limit. The current bandwidth is <<current_bandwidth>>, which exceeds <<percentage>> of the maximum supported limit of <<max_bandwidth>>. | We recommend that you connect the sensor to a more accurate switch location or purchase a sensor with enhanced hardware specifications.|
|**Number of monitored devices is close to its limit** |The sensor is close to exceeding its monitored devices limit. The current number of monitored devices is <<current_devices>>, which exceeds <<percentage>> of the maximum supported limit of <<max_devices>>. | We recommend that you connect the sensor to a more accurate switch location or purchase a sensor with enhanced hardware specifications.|
|**Disk is almost full** |The sensor hard disk is close to reaching its capacity. <<user>> has reached <<storage>>, which exceeds <<percentage>> of <<max_storage>>. | Open a support ticket. |

## Healthy messages

|Title  |Message  |Recommendation  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Pending activation** |Waiting for sensor to connect for the first time | Upload the activation file to the sensor. If this doesn't resolve the problem, verify the sensor’s ability to communicate with Azure.|
|**Pending reactivation** |Waiting for reactivation with new license | Upload the new activation file to the sensor. If this doesn't resolve the problem, verify the sensor’s ability to communicate with Azure. |

## Next steps

Remediate each error as recommended. For more information, see [Manage sensors with Defender for IoT in the Azure portal](how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud.md).
