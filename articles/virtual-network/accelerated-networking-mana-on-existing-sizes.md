# MANA support for existing VM Sizes

The following documentation is for customers of existing VM Sizes and using Accelerated Networking. To learn more about Accelerated Networking and the Networking performance benefits it provides, check out the [Accelerated Networking Overview](https://aks.ms/accelnet).

Per the [announcement](https://aka.ms/announcemanasupportforexistingvms), General Purpose Compute VM deployments can be deployed on compute hardware equipped with the [Microsoft Azure Network Adapter](/azure/virtual-network/accelerated-networking-mana-overview). Initially, this applies only for Intel based VM Sizes. ARM (Cobalt) and AMD based VM Sizes will be supported in the future.

The Microsoft Azure Network Adapter (MANA) was introduced in February 2025 with the Intel v6 family of sizes as part of Azure Boost. MANA is an Azure optimized, performance focused, Accelerated Networking device that is an integral part of the newest Azure Boost offerings.

For optimal Accelerated Networking performance, the Virtual Machine (VM) should use an operating system that fully supports NVIDIA `ConnectX-3`, `ConnectX-4 Lx`, `ConnectX-5`, **and** `MANA`.

When a VM using an operating system that doesn't support MANA is deployed on MANA hardware, it falls back to the NetVSC network adapter. In this scenario, the MANA Virtual Function (VF) will be visible, but no network interfaces are exposed by the MANA driver. Accelerated Networking performance for a VM falling back to the NetVSC network adapter is expected to be close to SR-IOV/VF mode NVIDIA `ConnectX-3`, `ConnectX-4 Lx`, `ConnectX-5`. A high number of concurrent connections can cause performance degradation.

While Microsoft has performed extensive testing across a wide range of use cases, there remains a possibility that virtual machines may experience intermittent connectivity or degraded performance.  

For best performance and overall experience, it's recommended that customers migrate to the latest generation of VMs. At a minimum, ensure your operating systems fully support MANA. 

## FAQ

### My workload doesn’t use Accelerated Networking. Can I expect any changes?
No. If your workload doesn’t support Accelerated Networking today, there's no impact or change to your workload. However, for the best performance, the recommendation is to use Accelerated Networking. [Accelerated Networking Overview](https://aks.ms/accelnet) has more information about Accelerated Networking.

### What VM sizes are impacted by this change?
Dsv5, Dv5, Ddsv5, Ddv5, Dlsv5, Dldsv5, Esv5, Ev5, Edsv5, Edv5, Ebsv5, Ebdsv5, Dsv4, Dv4, Ddsv4, Ddv4, Esv4, Ev4, Edsv4, Edv4, Dsv3, Dv3, Esv3, Ev3, Bsv2, Dv2, Dsv2, Av2, Fsv2, Fs, F, G, GS, Ls 

Note that some of these VM sizes will soon be retired. It's highly recommended that customers utilize the latest generations of Azure VMs for improved performance, functionality, and resiliency. 

### Will existing VMs deployed on MANA hardware?
VMs already deployed will be eligible to land on MANA capable hardware following a "stop-deallocate and start" command, or through a redeploy operation. All new VMs in the series listed above are eligible to be deployed on MANA capable hardware as well. 

### How will I know if my VM is deployed on MANA capable hardware? 

To determine if your VM Guest Operating System supports MANA, follow the instructions described in [Linux VMs with the Microsoft Azure Network Adapter](/azure/virtual-network/accelerated-networking-mana-linux). You'll see a PCIe device in the virtual machine and on the bonded NIC.

### What will be the performance implications for Accelerated Networking enabled VMs? 
If the VM’s underlying operating system supports all network devices used in Azure, there's no expected change in performance. This is because networking limits are associated with the VM Size as opposed to the underlying hosting infrastructure.  

If the VM’s underlying operating system isn't fully compatible with MANA, it will fall back to the NetVSC network adapter. In this scenario, due to advancements in host infrastructure technology, the Accelerated Networking performance is expected to be comparable to NVIDIA ConnectX-3, ConnectX-4 Lx, ConnectX-5.

>While Azure has performed extensive testing across a wide range of use cases, there remains a rare possibility that virtual machines may experience intermittent connectivity or degraded performance. In such an instance, it is highly recommended to migrate to the latest generation of VMs or at a minimum, utilize operating systems that fully support MANA. You should see a PCIe device in the virtual machine as well as the bonded NIC.

### I use a DPDK-based application that doesn't yet support MANA, will there be any impact to my workload? 
Yes. We recommend that you update your DPDK-based applications to support MANA. Information on DPDK with MANA can be found in [Microsoft Azure Network Adapter (MANA) and DPDK on Linux](/azure/virtual-network/setup-dpdk-mana).

### What are the minimum requirements to support MANA and DPDK? 
Visit [Microsoft Azure Network Adapter (MANA) and DPDK on Linux](/azure/virtual-network/setup-dpdk-mana) for the minimum requirements to support MANA and DPDK. 

### Are Network Virtual Appliances (NVAs) impacted by this change? 
NVAs based on the VM Sizes listed above may also be deployed on MANA capable hardware starting in March 2026. Visit [NVA Support insert link to NVA doc page][def] for more information about MANA support for NVAs. 

### Where can I find more information about MANA? 
To learn more about MANA, visit [Microsoft Azure Network Adapter](/azure/virtual-network/accelerated-networking-mana-overview). On this page you can learn more about operating system support for MANA, installing MANA device drivers (Windows), and more information about MANA capabilities.  

### What should I do if I have issues? 
We’re here to help. Contact Microsoft Support, who can assist with troubleshooting, guidance, and next steps. You can open a support request through the Azure portal by selecting Help + support, or visit the Microsoft Support site to start a new case. A support engineer reviews your request, engage internal teams as needed, and keep you updated until the issue is resolved.
