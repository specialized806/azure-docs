# Virtual Network Routing Appliance overview

Azure Virtual Network Routing Appliance is a high-performance routing solution that provides a managed, scalable forwarding layer for your virtual networks. Unlike traditional hub-and-spoke architectures that rely on virtual machines for routing, Virtual Network Routing Routing Appliance runs on specialized networking hardware to deliver low latency and high throughput for your traffic flows.

As a top-level Azure resource, Virtual Network Routing Appliance integrates with Azure's management model, so you can deploy, configure, and govern it using familiar Azure tools and processes. You deploy the appliance in a dedicated subnet within your virtual network, where it acts as a high-bandwidth forwarding layer for routed traffic.

Virtual Network Routing Appliance is ideal for organizations that need to:

- Scale routing capacity horizontally to meet growing bandwidth demands
- Reduce latency for east-west traffic flows
- Eliminate routing bottlenecks in hub-and-spoke network topologies
- Maintain Azure-native management and governance

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Virtual Network Routing Appliance is currently in PREVIEW.
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.


Virtual Network Routing Routing Appliance is an Azure-managed network routing device that you deploy inside your virtual network. It acts as a high-bandwidth forwarding layer for routed traffic flows, so you don't need to run your own virtual machines as the forwarding layer.

Key characteristics:  

- Azure resource model: You create and manage Virtual Network Routing Appliance as an Azure resource, similar to other networking resources.  
- Dedicated subnet: You host the appliance in a dedicated subnet named "VirtualNetworkApplianceSubnet."  
- In the data path: The appliance forwards traffic (data path).

## Benefits

### High throughput and low latency forwarding layer

Many hub and spoke designs rely on a centralized forwarder that can become a bottleneck. Virtual Network Routing Appliance is a lightweight, high-performance forwarding layer that reduces the risk of the forwarding layer becoming the choke point for traffic flows.

### Purpose-built for horizontal scaling and accelerated east–west flows

Virtual Network Routing Appliance is purpose-built for horizontal scaling, accelerated east–west flows, high throughput, and low latency to meet massive bandwidth demands.

### Azure-native management model

Because Virtual Network Routing Appliance is a top-level Azure resource, you can manage and govern it like other Azure networking resources.
