After **March 31, 2027**, all customers using Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal will be [redirected to the Defender portal and will use Microsoft Sentinel in the Defender portal only](../overview.md#microsoft-sentinel-in-the-azure-portal-retirement-timeline). 

If you're still using Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal, we recommend that you start planning your [transition to the Defender portal](../move-to-defender.md) to ensure a smooth transition and take full advantage of the [unified security operations experience offered by Microsoft Defender](/unified-secops-platform/overview-unified-security).
