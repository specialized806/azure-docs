# Track your Conditional Azure Credit Offer (CACO)

A Conditional Azure Credit Offer (CACO) is a contractual agreement in which your organization commits to specific, predefined spend targets within set time periods and receives Azure credits for meeting these targets. A CACO is composed of multiple milestones with specific spend targets and an associated ACO award at the end of each milestone, allowing your organization to align rewards with your consumption patterns and business goals.


## Prerequisites

To view CACO details, you must have any of the following roles:

**Billing Account Access**
- Owner, Contributor, or Reader role on the Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) billing account

**Subscription Access** 
- Owner, Contributor, or Reader role on the subscription where the CACO resource is created

> [!NOTE]
> You only need permissions at one of these levels to view CACO details and track milestone progress.

## CACO Page Overview

The Conditional Azure Credit Offer (CACO) tab has the following sections.

#### Overall commitment 

:::image type="content" source="../../manage/media/conditional-credit-offer/conditional-credit-offer-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of CACO page." lightbox="../../manage/media/conditional-credit-offer/conditional-credit-offer-page.png" :::

The overall commitment displays the total commitment amount for your CACO, across milestones.

#### Details

The Details section displays other important aspects of your commitment.

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| ID | An identifier that uniquely identifies your CACO. |
| Start date | The date when the commitment becomes effective. |
| End date | The date when the commitment expires, which is the end date of the last milestone. |

| Status | The status of your commitment. |

Your CACO can have one of the following statuses:

- **Scheduled:** The CACO has a future start date and isn't yet active. No eligible Azure spend contributes toward your commitment until the start date is reached.
- **Active:** The CACO is currently in effect. Eligible Azure spend contributes toward fulfilling your commitment.
- **Completed:** The CACO commitment amount is fully met. No further action is required.
- **Expired:** The CACO end date passes without the commitment being fully met. Contact your Microsoft Account team for more information.
- **Canceled:** The CACO is terminated before the end date. New Azure spend doesn't contribute toward your CACO commitment. Contact your Microsoft Account team for more information.

#### Upcoming Milestone

The Upcoming Milestone section displays the next milestone that needs to be achieved to earn the associated ACO award.

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| Start Date | The date when the milestone period begins |
| End Date | The date by which the milestone must be met |
| Consumption target | The spending amount required to achieve this milestone |
| Target ACO | The Azure Credit Offer award amount you receive for meeting this milestone |
| Status | Whether the milestone is active, pending, met, or missed |

You can select **Show all Milestones** to view the complete list of milestones for your CACO commitment.

#### Transactions

This section displays transactions that decremented your CACO commitment.

| Term | Definition |

## CACO Milestones

Every CACO offer consists of one or many milestones with a target amount, date, and corresponding credit award for meeting the milestone amount. 

- **Met milestone:** If you meet a milestone by its due date, you receive the corresponding ACO (Azure Credit Offer) award associated with that milestone.

- **Missed milestone:** If you don't meet a milestone by its due date, the system forfeits the ACO award corresponding to that milestone.

#### All Milestones

When you select **Show all Milestones**, you can view a comprehensive list of all milestones associated with your CACO commitment. This view provides detailed information about each milestone's progress and status.

| Column | Definition |
|---|---|
| Id | The unique identifier for each milestone (for example, Milestone1, Milestone2, Milestone3) |
| End Date | The deadline by which the milestone must be achieved |
| Consumption target | The total spending amount required to meet this milestone |
| Progress% | The current progress percentage toward achieving the milestone consumption target |
| ACO award | The Azure Credit Offer amount you receive if the milestone is met |
| Status | The current status of the milestone |

**Milestone statuses:**

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Scheduled | The milestone has a future start date and isn't yet active. |
| Active | The milestone is currently in progress and eligible Azure spend contributes toward fulfilling the milestone target.  |
| Pending | The milestone is pending evaluation. |
| Completed | The milestone target is successfully met within the specified timeframe and the system grants the associated ACO award. |
| Missed | The milestone deadline passes without meeting the consumption target. The system forfeits the ACO award corresponding to this milestone. |
| Canceled | The system cancels the milestone before completion. This situation may occur when you modify or terminate the overall CACO commitment. |
| Removed | The system removes the milestone from the CACO commitment. This status typically occurs when you renegotiate commitment terms. |


## CACO Alerts

Microsoft sends email notifications to Billing Account Admins to help ensure CACO commitments and milestones are met on time to receive ACO awards. These alerts provide advance notice so you can take action before forfeiting ACO awards.

### CACO expiry alerts

If your CACO target isn't reached, email notifications are sent to Billing Account Admins at the following intervals before the CACO end date:

- 90 days before expiry
- 60 days before expiry
- 30 days before expiry

### Milestone alerts

Email alerts are sent to Billing Account Admins at the following intervals before each milestone due date if the milestone target isn't met:

- 90 days before milestone due date
- 60 days before milestone due date
- 30 days before milestone due date

## Azure Services eligible for CACO

CACO spend eligibility differs from traditional MACC (Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment) in several key areas. The following table outlines which Azure services and purchases are eligible for CACO spend tracking:

| Service/Purchase Type | CACO Eligibility | MACC Eligibility | Notes |
|----------------------|------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **All consumption pay-as-you-go charges** | ✅ | ✅ | Standard consumption charges count toward CACO milestones |
| **Azure 1st party entitlement purchases (Reserved Instances/Azure Savings Plans)** |  |  |  |
| - Upfront/Monthly Billing | ✅ | ✅ | Initial purchase or monthly payments count toward milestones |
| - Monthly Usage | ❌ | ❌ | Usage covered by these purchases doesn't count |
| **Azure Pre-payments (Monetary Credits)** |  |  |  |
| - Purchase | ❌ | ✅ | **Key Difference**: CACO doesn't count prepayment purchases |
| - Prepayment Spend | ✅ | ❌ | **Key Difference**: CACO counts spending of prepayment credits |
| **MACC Milestone Shortfall Credit** |  |  |  |
| - Purchase | ❌ | ✅ | Milestone shortfall credit purchase doesn't count toward CACO |
| - Credit Applied | ✅ | ❌ | Milestone shortfall credit use goes towards CACO |
| **MACC Shortfall Charge (Credit)** |  |  |  |
| - Purchase | ❌ | ✅ | MACC shortfall credit purchase doesn't count toward CACO |
| - Credit Applied | ❌ | ❌ | MACC shortfall credit use doesn't go towards CACO as it's the penalty charge for not fulfilling MACC commitment |
| **Awarded Credits (ACO, Outage, Goodwill)** |  |  |  |
| - Awarded Amount | ❌ | ❌ | Any credits that aren't purchased don't count towards commitments |
| - Credit Applied | ❌ | ❌ | Consumption covered by awarded credits doesn't count |
| **Azure Marketplace** | ❌ | ✅ | **Key Difference**: Marketplace purchases don't count toward CACO milestones |

### Key Differences from MACC

**CACO focuses on actual consumption rather than purchases:**
- **Azure Prepayments**: Unlike MACC where prepayment purchases count toward commitment but prepayment spending doesn't, CACO operates on the opposite principle - prepayment purchases don't count toward milestones, but spending those prepayment credits does count toward your CACO commitment
- **Marketplace purchases**: Not eligible for CACO milestone tracking (unlike MACC)

This consumption-focused approach ensures that ACO awards are based on genuine Azure service consumption rather than upfront credit purchases, regardless of the payment method used to cover that consumption.
