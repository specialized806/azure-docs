# High-availability implementation guide for using Azure Front Door and alternate ingress solutions

Azure Front Door is designed to provide exceptional resilience and availability for both external customers and Microsoft's internal properties. Although the architecture of Azure Front Door meets or exceeds the needs of most production workloads, no distributed system is immune to failure.

This article provides high‑level, step‑by‑step instructions for implementing Azure Traffic Manager to enable manual failover from Azure Front Door to either an alternate content delivery network (CDN) or Azure Application Gateway web application firewall (WAF) during rare Azure Front Door service interruptions. It supplements the guidance in [Global routing redundancy for mission-critical web applications](/azure/architecture/guide/networking/global-web-applications/overview).

Multiple strategies exist within the industry for achieving high availability (HA) in CDN and web application architectures. The approach outlined in this article focuses on a straightforward, manual "break‑glass" failover pattern. Customers can use the pattern to quickly redirect traffic during an outage and seamlessly restore routing back to Azure Front Door after service health is confirmed.

The article also includes guidance for implementing HA patterns in production environments, establishing health monitoring, and creating operational runbooks to support ongoing readiness.

## Key operational differences

This guide presents two proven architectures that use Traffic Manager to provide automated failover. The following table summarizes key operational differences to consider:

| Aspect | Scenario 1 (Azure Front Door + Application Gateway) | Scenario 2 (Azure Front Door + other CDN) |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Failover target | Secondary Traffic Manager instance and multiple Application Gateway instances | Single other CDN endpoint |
| Caching during failover | No (Application Gateway doesn't cache) | Yes |
| Geographic distribution | Specific Azure regions (two in Scenario 1 of this article) | Other CDN's global edge network |
| WAF protection | Azure Web Application Firewall (consistent rule sets) | Other CDN's WAF (different rule sets) |
| Cost during standby | Fixed compute costs (Application Gateway charges even when idle: ~\$200-400/month for WAF_v2 with minimal capacity) | Dependent on CDN vendor's pricing |

## Considerations for production environments

When you're implementing HA architectures for production workloads, consider the following best practices and important notes:

- Don't configure the primary Traffic Manager instance for automatic failover.

  Azure Traffic Manager health probes originate only from US-based Azure regions. For probes of Azure Front Door endpoints (or any CDN by using anycast routing), these US-based probes almost always reach US POP servers and leave the health of non-US POP servers unverified. This situation prevents Traffic Manager from automatically failing over between Azure Azure Front Door and another ingress service based on the true global health of the anycast CDN, such as Azure Front Door.
  
  For global workloads that require health validation from multiple geographies, manual failover with weighted routing and monitoring disabled provides more reliable control than automated health-based routing.

- If you're currently using Azure Front Door-managed certifications, you must migrate to bring-your-own (BYO) certificates. By using your own certificate, you can keep the TLS certificates consistent regardless of which ingress path the traffic follows.

  Ensure that your TLS certificates are compatible with Azure Front Door. For more information, see [Configure HTTPS on an Azure Front Door custom domain](/azure/frontdoor/standard-premium/how-to-configure-https-custom-domain) and [TLS encryption with Azure Front Door](/azure/frontdoor/end-to-end-tls).

- Always test failover procedures ahead of time in non-production environments first.

- Traffic Manager doesn't support CNAME flattening at the DNS zone apex (root domain). If you require Traffic Manager at the apex, you must use DNS providers that support alias records or similar mechanisms. [Azure DNS](/azure/dns/dns-alias) is one such DNS provider.

- Use short DNS time-to-live (TTL) values (300 to 600 seconds), and monitor DNS TTL propagation times.

- Lock down Application Gateway with network security groups (NSGs) and access control lists (ACLs). Allow required platform ranges and inbound application ports. Keep origins secured for all ingress paths. For more information, see [Network security groups](/azure/application-gateway/configuration-infrastructure#network-security-groups).

  Although an Application Gateway WAF mitigates HTTP/L7 attacks, NSGs provide packet filtering only and don't protect against volumetric or protocol-level (L3/L4) DDoS attacks. All Azure public endpoints benefit from baseline, always-on DDoS protection in the Azure platform. It helps protect the Azure infrastructure but doesn't include workload-specific tuning, telemetry, cost protection, or availability guarantees.
  
  For production and mission-critical workloads, consider the Azure DDoS Protection service to help protect Application Gateway public IPs. For more information, see [Azure DDoS Protection pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/ddos-protection).

- Document WAF rule differences between Azure Front Door and failover solutions.

- We don't recommend Azure Private Link for these HA architectures because alternate CDN platforms can't access origins protected by Private Link integration in Azure Front Door.

  Also, Application Gateway requires extra virtual network and private endpoint configuration to reach private origins. Application Gateway can't use the native Private Link capabilities of Azure Front Door.
  
  For production environments that use Azure Front Door alongside other CDN providers, consider using alternative, CDN‑agnostic origin‑security controls to enforce origin trust when you can't use Private Link or `X‑Azure‑FDID` validation. These controls might include token‑based origin authentication (HMAC or signed URLs), mutual TLS (mTLS), custom origin headers, and IP address filtering.

- Edit the sample commands listed in this guide so that they're tailored to your environment for automation and runbooks.

- Establish clear runbooks and test failover and failback procedures.

- Configure comprehensive monitoring and alerting for all endpoints.

- Validate functionality during failover to alternate ingress solutions.

- Test certificate renewal processes across all platforms.

- Regularly validate that failover endpoints remain functional (quarterly testing recommended).

- This guide uses Azure CLI sample commands that you run from PowerShell.

- Before you proceed, review [Global routing redundancy for mission-critical web applications](/azure/architecture/guide/networking/global-web-applications/overview).

## Scenario 1: Traffic Manager failover from Azure Front Door to an Application Gateway WAF

This DNS-based load balancing solution uses multiple Azure Traffic Manager profiles. In the unlikely event of an availability problem with Azure Front Door, Traffic Manager redirects traffic through the Application Gateway WAF. The primary Traffic Manager instance routes traffic between Azure Front Door (primary) and a nested secondary Traffic Manager instance that points to multi-region Application Gateway instances. During an Azure Front Door outage, traffic is manually failed over to regional Application Gateway deployments that have WAF protection.

:::image type="content" source="./media/high-availability/front-door-application-gateway.svg" alt-text="Diagram that shows Traffic Manager with weighted routing to Azure Front Door, and a nested Traffic Manager profile that uses performance routing to send to Application Gateway instances in two regions." border="false" lightbox="./media/high-availability/front-door-application-gateway.svg":::

- **Traffic flow (normal operation)**: User → DNS query → primary Traffic Manager instance (weighted/always-serve routing) → Azure Front Door (priority 1) → origin servers.
  
- **Traffic flow (Azure Front Door failure)**: User → DNS query → primary Traffic Manager  instance (weighted/always-serve routing) → secondary Traffic Manager instance (priority mode) → Application Gateway → origin servers.

### Pre-deployment: Azure Front Door vs. Application Gateway

It's important to understand the feature differences between Azure Front Door and an Application Gateway WAF, in case you're using any features that an Application Gateway WAF doesn't offer. The following two tables provide an overview.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This solution assumes that you're currently using Azure Front Door to serve traffic across multiple regions or globally. In this design, the steps that follow introduce a secondary Traffic Manager instance that's configured with performance routing between the primary Traffic Manager instance and regional Application Gateway instances.
>
> This approach is necessary because Azure Front Door is a global Layer‑7 service. The secondary Traffic Manager instance effectively replaces global latency‑based routing in Azure Front Door by acting as the global load‑balancing layer. As a result, Traffic Manager preserves latency‑optimized user routing for a geographically distributed audience.
>
> Given this architectural shift, you must evaluate global traffic patterns and deploy Application Gateway instances in regions that have meaningful user volume to ensure optimal performance and resilience.

#### Feature differences

#### WAF differences

| Azure Front Door | Application Gateway |
| ---- | ---- |
| Microsoft Default Rule Set (DRS 2.1) | OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS 3.2 or 4.0) |
| Rule IDs: 949xxx series | Rule IDs: 9xxxxx series |
| Azure Front Door WAF (DRS): inspects first 128 KB of request body | Application Gateway WAF (CRS 3.2+): up to 2 MB inspection; 4 GB file upload; enforcement and inspection can be configured independently |

### Recommendations

- Because you must maintain distinct rule sets for each WAF, use the Azure Front Door rule set as your baseline. Create an Application Gateway rule set that matches the Azure Front Door rule set as closely as possible.

- Test the Application Gateway WAF separately and independently.

- Document all custom exclusions for both platforms.

- Regularly audit rule sets for consistency.

- Adhere to the network guidance in [Azure Application Gateway infrastructure configuration](/azure/application-gateway/configuration-infrastructure). Be sure to exercise the following virtual network and subnet requirements:

- Use the following subnet sizing (per region):

  - Minimum: /27 (32 addresses)

  - Recommended: /24 (256 addresses) for autoscaling and hitless maintenance

  - Formula: (max instances \* 10) + 5 Azure reserved IPs

  - Example: 20 max instances → (20 \* 10) + 5 = 205 IPs → use /24

- For optimal security, use a dedicated subnet for Application Gateway (no other resources).

- Make sure that the inbound connection allows:

  - 443/80 from Internet (or specific source ranges)

  - 65200-5535 from GatewayManager (Application Gateway v2)

  - AzureLoadBalancer

  - Block other inbound. Don't block required outbound internet

  - Use ASGs for backend segmentation and least-privilege rules

For capacity planning and autoscaling strategy, see [Architecture best practices for Azure Application Gateway v2](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/azure-application-gateway).

### Key implementation steps

#### Step 1: Provision prerequisites

- Azure Front Door configured with custom domain and BYO certificate.

- Lower DNS TTL for your CNAME is Azure Front Door serving traffic to the lowest time setting.

- Azure subscription with permissions to create virtual networks, Application Gateway, and Traffic Manager.

- SSL/TLS certificate in Azure Key Vault or available for upload.

- Origin servers accessible from Azure virtual networks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're currently using Azure Front Door-managed certificates, you must migrate to BYO certificates before implementing this solution. Azure Front Door-managed certificates can't be exported and installed on alternative CDNs. For more information, see [Configure HTTPS on an Azure Front Door custom domain](/azure/frontdoor/standard-premium/how-to-configure-https-custom-domain).

#### Step 2: Deploy Application Gateway (Region 1)

1. Create network infrastructure for Application Gateway. For more information, see [Application Gateway infrastructure configuration](/azure/application-gateway/configuration-infrastructure).

1. Create a managed identity and grant Key Vault access. For more information, see [TLS termination with Key Vault certificates](/azure/application-gateway/key-vault-certs).

    Application Gateway requires the SSL/TLS certificate in PFX format with private key. The certificate must be accessible from Azure Key Vault or uploaded directly. Use the same certificate that Azure Front Door uses to ensure consistent TLS behavior.

1. Create a WAF policy. For more information, see [Create Web Application Firewall policies for Application Gateway](/azure/web-application-firewall/ag/create-waf-policy-ag)

1. Create Application Gateway with HTTPS and WAF. For more information, see [Configure an Application Gateway with TLS termination](/azure/application-gateway/create-ssl-portal).

1. Configure a backend host header. For more information, see [Troubleshoot backend health issues in Application Gateway](/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-backend-health-troubleshooting)

1. Verify Application Gateway:

    ```
    # Get Application Gateway public IP
    $APPGW_IP = az network public-ip show `
        --name $APPGW_PIP_NAME_R1 `
        --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP `
        --query ipAddress -o tsv
    Write-Host "Application Gateway IP: $APPGW_IP"
    
    # Test Application Gateway directly (SkipCertificateCheck because cert is for domain, not IP)
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://$APPGW_IP/index.html" -Method Head -SkipCertificateCheck
    ```

    **Expected result**: StatusCode 200. If you get 502 Bad Gateway, ensure the backend HTTP settings have `--host-name-from-backend-pool true` enabled.

#### Step 3: Configure WAF policy settings (optional)

By default, WAF is created in Detection mode. Prevention mode actively blocks malicious requests. Test thoroughly before enabling Prevention mode in production.

Evaluate your global traffic patterns and deploy Application Gateway instances in regions with meaningful user volume. If you're deploying multi-region Application Gateway, repeat Steps 2 and 3 for each additional region (for example, West US 2) by using different virtual network address spaces (10.2.0.0/16, 10.3.0.0/16, etc.) and region-specific variable suffixes (R2, R3, etc.).

#### Step 4: Create Traffic Manager architecture to support the Application Gateway WAF endpoints

1. Create a Secondary "Performance Mode" Traffic Manager as shown in Scenario 1 diagram. For more information, see [Create a Traffic Manager profile](/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-create-profile)

    **Single-region configuration**:

    - Routing method: Priority
    - Endpoint: Single Application Gateway public IP address

    **Multi-region configuration**:

    - Routing method: Performance (routes users to nearest healthy Application Gateway)
    - Endpoints: Multiple Application Gateway public IP addresses across regions
    - Endpoint Locations: Specify Azure region for each endpoint (required for Performance routing)

    **Configuration**:

    | Setting | Value | Notes |
    | ---- | ---- | ---- |
    | **Routing method** | Performance (multi-region) or Priority (single-region) | Performance optimizes latency for multi-region |
    | **Protocol** | HTTPS | Validates Application Gateway health via HTTPS |
    | **Port** | 443 | Standard HTTPS port |
    | **Path** | /health or /index.html | Must match Application Gateway backend health probe path |
    | **TTL** | 300 seconds | Balances DNS query load and responsiveness |

    **Application Gateway public IP limitation**: By default, Azure public IPs don't have DNS names configured. You must use the public IP address directly in Traffic Manager endpoints, not a DNS name. The `--endpoint-location` parameter is required for Performance routing to enable geographic routing.

1. Create a Primary "Weighted Mode Always Serve" Traffic Manager as shown in Scenario 1 diagram. For more information, see [Create a Traffic Manager profile](/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-create-profile)

    **Configurations for both endpoints**:

    | Setting | Value | Notes |
    | ---- | ---- | ---- |
    | **Routing Method** | Weighted | Allows manual control via endpoint status (Enabled/Disabled) |
    | **Weight** | 100 |   |
    | **Protocol** | HTTPS | Required for validating SSL/TLS endpoints |
    | **Port** | 443 | Standard HTTPS port |
    | **Path** | /index.html | Choose a lightweight endpoint for health checks |
    | **TTL** | 300 seconds | DNS TTL - lower values enable faster failover but increase DNS queries |
    | **Health Check** | Always serve traffic | Don't enable Health checks |

    **Endpoint-specific configurations**:

    **Primary endpoint**:

    - **Name**: endpoint-afd-primary

    - **Type**: External endpoint

    - **Target**: Azure Front Door endpoint hostname (for example, `myapp-12345.z01.azurefd.net`)

    - **End Point Status**: Enabled

    - **Custom headers**: `Host=$CUSTOM_DOMAIN` (required for Azure Front Door to route to correct custom domain)

    - **Health checks**: Always serve traffic (disable health checks)

    :::image type="content" source="./media/high-availability/traffic-manager-primary-endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of adding Traffic Manager primary endpoint in the Azure portal." lightbox="./media/high-availability/traffic-manager-primary-endpoint.png":::

    **Secondary endpoint**:

    - **Name**: endpoint-appgw-secondary

    - **Type**: External endpoint

    - **Target**: Secondary Traffic Manager FQDN (for example, `myapp-appgw.trafficmanager.net`)

    - **End Point Status**: Disabled

    :::image type="content" source="./media/high-availability/traffic-manager-secondary-endpoint-application-gateway.png" alt-text="Screenshot of adding Traffic Manager secondary endpoint." lightbox="./media/high-availability/traffic-manager-secondary-endpoint-application-gateway.png":::

1. Verify Traffic Manager health:

    ```azurecli
    # Check endpoint health status
    az network traffic-manager profile show `
        --name $ATM_PRIMARY_PROFILE `
        --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP `
        --query "{ProfileStatus:profileStatus, MonitorStatus:monitorConfig.profileMonitorStatus, Endpoints:endpoints\[\].{Name:name, Target:target, Priority:priority, Status:endpointMonitorStatus}}"
    ```

    **Expected result**: Both endpoints should show `Status: Online`. If an endpoint shows `Degraded` or `CheckingEndpoint`, wait 1-2 minutes for health probes to complete.

#### Step 5: Update DNS CNAME to Traffic Manager and verify update

> [!WARNING]
> The following steps will redirect your production traffic from Azure Front Door directly to Traffic Manager and cause a potential service impact. Before you proceed:
>
> - Test these steps in a non-production environment first. For example, temporarily modify the local `hosts` file on a non‑production workstation to resolve the custom domain to the Traffic Manager endpoint, allowing validation without affecting live traffic.
> - Reduce your DNS CNAME TTL to the lowest value possible (for example, 60-300 seconds) at least 24 hours before making changes.
> - Plan for a maintenance window during low-traffic periods if possible.
> - Have rollback procedures ready in case issues arise.

1. Update your DNS CNAME record to point to the **Primary** Traffic Manager instead of directly to Azure Front Door.

    | Field | Old value | New value |
    | ---- | ---- | ---- |
    | **Name / Host** | www | www (no change) |
    | **Value / Points to** | Azure Front Door endpoint hostname | `$ATM_DNS_NAME.trafficmanager.net` |

1. Verify Traffic Manager resolution (wait for DNS propagation and test)

    DNS propagation typically takes 5-10 minutes but can take up to 48 hours globally. Monitor propagation progress and test HTTPS connectivity:

    ```
    # Verify Traffic Manager profile is resolving
    nslookup "$ATM_DNS_NAME.trafficmanager.net"
    ```

    **Expected result**: Should return IP address(es) of Azure Front Door endpoint.

    ```
    # Check DNS from different resolvers
    nslookup $CUSTOM_DOMAIN 8.8.8.8 # Google DNS
    
    # Test HTTPS connectivity
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://$CUSTOM_DOMAIN/index.html" -Method Head
    ```

    **Expected result**: StatusCode 200

1. Monitor Azure Front Door

    After the DNS cutover, actively monitor the following Azure Front Door metrics:

    - Request count: Should remain consistent (no drop in traffic)

    - Response time: Should remain within normal ranges

    - Error rates: 4xx/5xx errors shouldn't increase

    - Origin health: Backend health should remain Online

#### Step 6: Test failover procedures

1. Simulate Azure Front Door failure (manual failover to Application Gateway):

    ```
    # Manual failover to Application Gateway
    # Disable Azure Front Door endpoint
    az network traffic-manager endpoint update `
        --name "endpoint-afd-primary" `
        --profile-name $ATM_PRIMARY_PROFILE `
        --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP `
        --type externalEndpoints `
        --endpoint-status Disabled
    
    # Enable secondary Traffic Manager endpoint (Application Gateway)
    az network traffic-manager endpoint update `
        --name "endpoint-appgw-secondary" `
        --profile-name $ATM_PRIMARY_PROFILE `
        --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP `
        --type externalEndpoints `
        --endpoint-status Enabled
    
    # Verify Traffic Manager endpoint status
    az network traffic-manager endpoint list `
        --profile-name $ATM_PRIMARY_PROFILE `
        --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP `
        --query "[].{Name:name, Status:endpointStatus, Health:endpointMonitorStatus}" `
        --output table
    
    # Flush DNS cache (Windows)
    ipconfig /flushdns
    
    # Verify DNS resolution (should now point to Secondary Traffic Manager and Application Gateway)
    nslookup $CUSTOM_DOMAIN
    
    # Test - should now work via Application Gateway
    curl --head https://$CUSTOM_DOMAIN/
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > DNS TTL affects failover time. With TTL of 60 seconds, clients might take up to 60 seconds to see the change. Use `nslookup` to verify that resolution points to Application Gateway.

2. Fail back to Azure Front Door:

    ```
    # Re-enable Azure Front Door endpoint
    az network traffic-manager endpoint update `
        --name "endpoint-afd-primary" `
        --profile-name $ATM_PRIMARY_PROFILE `
        --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP `
        --type externalEndpoints `
        --endpoint-status Enabled
    
    # Disable Application Gateway (via Secondary Traffic Manager)
    az network traffic-manager endpoint update `
        --name "endpoint-appgw-secondary" `
        --profile-name $ATM_PRIMARY_PROFILE `
        --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP `
        --type externalEndpoints `
        --endpoint-status Disabled
        
    # Verify endpoint status
    az network traffic-manager endpoint list `
        --profile-name $ATM_PRIMARY_PROFILE `
        --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP `
        --query "[].{Name:name, Status:endpointStatus, Health:endpointMonitorStatus}" `
        --output table
    
    # Flush DNS cache (Windows)
    ipconfig /flushdns
    
    # Verify DNS resolution (should now point back to Azure Front Door)
    nslookup $CUSTOM_DOMAIN
    
    # Test - should now work via Azure Front Door
    curl --head https://$CUSTOM_DOMAIN/
    ```

3. Verify current routing:

    ```
    # Check which endpoint is serving traffic
    nslookup $CUSTOM_DOMAIN
    
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://$CUSTOM_DOMAIN/index.html" -Method Head | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Headers
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The response headers can help identify the serving endpoint:
    > - Azure Front Door includes `x-azure-ref` header.
    > - Traffic that passes through Application Gateway might include `Server: Microsoft-IIS` or similar.

## Scenario 2: Traffic Manager failover from Azure Front Door to an alternative CDN

This solution uses a single Traffic Manager profile with weighted/always serve routing so that traffic can be manually switched over between Azure Front Door and an alternative CDN:

**Primary endpoint**: Azure Front Door custom domain endpoint.

**Secondary endpoint**: Alternative CDN endpoint.

:::image type="content" source="./media/high-availability/front-door-alternative-cdn.svg" alt-text="Diagram of Traffic Manager routing between Azure Front Door and another CDN." border="false" lightbox="./media/high-availability/front-door-alternative-cdn.svg":::

**Traffic flow (Normal Operation)**: User → DNS Query → Traffic Manager (weighted/always-serve routing) → Azure Front Door (priority 1) → origin servers.

**Traffic flow (Azure Front Door failure)**: User → DNS Query → Traffic Manager (Weighted routing / Always serve routing) → Alternative CDN (Priority 2) → Origin servers.

### Key implementation steps

#### Step 1: Provision prerequisites

Configure your secondary CDN provider with:

- Azure Front Door configured with custom domain and BYO certificate.

- Alternative CDN account.

- Lower DNS TTL for your CNAME is Azure Front Door serving traffic to the lowest time setting.

- Origin servers accessible by both Azure Front Door and the alternative CDN.

- Custom domain with ability to modify DNS records.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're currently using Azure Front Door-managed certificates, you must migrate to BYO certificates before implementing this HA solution. Azure Front Door-managed certificates can't be exported and installed on alternative CDNs. For more information, see [Configure HTTPS on an Azure Front Door custom domain](/azure/frontdoor/standard-premium/how-to-configure-https-custom-domain) for BYO certificate configuration instructions.

#### Step 2: Configure alternative CDN

Configure your secondary CDN provider:

- Set up CDN zone/property with your custom domain.

- Configure origin servers (same as Azure Front Door backend pool).

- **Upload BYO SSL/TLS certificate**: (the same certificate used in Azure Front Door).

- **Replicate caching rules**: Configure CDN caching rules to match Azure Front Door behavior (cache durations, query string handling, etc.)

- **Enable similar features**: Set up caching settings, control headers, and compression settings to match Azure Front Door configuration.

- Set up WAF rules if the CDN provider offers WAF capabilities (attempt to match Azure Front Door WAF policy).

- Configure custom domain to match your Azure Front Door custom domain (for example, `www.contoso.com`).

- Record the CDN edge hostname for Traffic Manager configuration (for example, `your-site.cdn.provider.net`).

#### Step 3: Create Traffic Manager profile

Apply the following configuration to create the Traffic Manager profile. For more information, see [Create a Traffic Manager profile](/azure/traffic-manager/quickstart-create-traffic-manager-profile).

| Setting | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **Routing Method** | Weighted | Allows manual control via endpoint status (Enabled/Disabled). |
| **Weight** | 100 | Enter 100 when the Traffic Manager profile is created and for both endpoints. |
| **Protocol** | HTTPS | Required for validating SSL/TLS endpoints. |
| **Port** | 443 | Standard HTTPS port. |
| **Path** | /index.html | Choose a lightweight endpoint for health checks. |
| **TTL** | 300 seconds | DNS TTL - lower values enable faster failover but increase DNS queries. |

#### Step 4: Configure Traffic Manager endpoints

Create two endpoints within the Traffic Manager profile with the following configurations:

**Primary endpoint (Azure Front Door)**:

- Name: endpoint-afd-primary

- Type: External endpoint

- Target: Azure Front Door endpoint hostname (for example, `myapp-endpoint-12345.z01.azurefd.net`)

- Weight: 100

- Status: Enabled (initially)

- Custom headers: `Host=$CUSTOM_DOMAIN` (required for Azure Front Door to route to correct custom domain)

- Health checks: Always serve traffic (disable health checks)

**Custom headers for Azure Front Door**: The `--custom-headers "Host=$CUSTOM_DOMAIN"` parameter is critical for Azure Front Door endpoints. Without it, Azure Front Door might not properly route requests to your custom domain configuration. It's a supported feature of Azure Traffic Manager.

**Secondary endpoint (alternative CDN)**:

- Name: endpoint-cdn-secondary

- Type: External endpoint

- Target: CDN edge hostname (for example, `myapp.cdn.net`)

- Weight: 100

- Status: Disabled (initially - standby mode)

#### Step 5: Update DNS CNAME to Traffic Manager and verify update

> [!WARNING]
> The configurations in this step will redirect your production traffic from Azure Front Door directly to Traffic Manager. Before you proceed, ensure that you took the following steps:
>
> - Test these steps in a non-production environment first.
> - Reduce your DNS CNAME TTL to the lowest value possible (for example, 60-300 seconds) at least 24 hours before making changes.
> - Plan for a maintenance window during low-traffic periods if possible.
> - Have rollback procedures ready in case issues arise.

1. Update your DNS CNAME record to point to Traffic Manager instead of directly to Azure Front Door:

    | Field | Old value | New value |
    | ---- | ---- | ---- |
    | Name/Host | www | www (no change) |
    | Value/Points to | Azure Front Door endpoint hostname | `$ATM_CDN_DNS_NAME.trafficmanager.net` |

    > [!NOTE]
    > DNS propagation typically takes 5-10 minutes but can take up to 48 hours globally.

2. Verify Traffic Manager resolution. Wait for DNS propagation and test HTTPS connectivity.

    ```
    # Verify Traffic Manager profile is resolving
    nslookup "$ATM_CDN_DNS_NAME.trafficmanager.net"
    # Expected result: Should return IP address(es) of Azure Front Door endpoint
    
    # Check DNS from different resolvers
    nslookup $CUSTOM_DOMAIN 8.8.8.8    # Google DNS
    
    # Test HTTPS connectivity
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://$CUSTOM_DOMAIN/index.html" -Method Head
    # Expected result: StatusCode 200
    ```

3. After the DNS cutover, actively monitor the following Azure Front Door metrics:

    - Request count: Should remain consistent (no drop in traffic).

    - Response time: Should remain within normal ranges.

    - Error rates: 4xx/5xx errors shouldn't increase.

    - Origin health: Backend health should remain Online.

#### Step 6: Test failover procedures

1. Manual failover to alternative CDN:

    ```
    # Failover: Disable Azure Front Door and enable CDN
    az network traffic-manager endpoint update `
        --name "endpoint-afd-primary" `
        --profile-name $ATM_CDN_PROFILE_NAME `
        --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP `
        --type externalEndpoints `
        --endpoint-status Disabled
    
    az network traffic-manager endpoint update `
        --name "endpoint-cdn-secondary" `
        --profile-name $ATM_CDN_PROFILE_NAME `
        --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP `
        --type externalEndpoints `
        --endpoint-status Enabled
    
    # Verify endpoint status
    az network traffic-manager profile show `
        --name $ATM_CDN_PROFILE_NAME `
        --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP `
        --query "endpoints[].{Name:name, Status:endpointStatus, Health:endpointMonitorStatus, Target:target}"
    
    # Flush local DNS cache and verify resolution
    ipconfig /flushdns
    nslookup "$ATM_CDN_DNS_NAME.trafficmanager.net"
    
    # Test HTTPS access
    curl --head https://$CUSTOM_DOMAIN/
    ```

2. Failback to Azure Front Door:

    ```
    # Failback: Enable Azure Front Door, Disable CDN
    az network traffic-manager endpoint update `
        --name "endpoint-afd-primary" `
        --profile-name $ATM_CDN_PROFILE_NAME `
        --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP `
        --type externalEndpoints `
        --endpoint-status Enabled
    
    az network traffic-manager endpoint update `
        --name "endpoint-cdn-secondary" `
        --profile-name $ATM_CDN_PROFILE_NAME `
        --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP `
        --type externalEndpoints `
        --endpoint-status Disabled
    
    # Verify
    az network traffic-manager profile show `
        --name $ATM_CDN_PROFILE_NAME `
        --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP `
        --query "endpoints[].{Name:name, Status:endpointStatus, Health:endpointMonitorStatus}"
    ```

## Monitoring

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Configure synthetic monitors to alert immediately on failures. These alerts should trigger manual failover if automatic failover is insufficient (for example, Azure Front Door custom domain issues that Traffic Manager can't detect).

The following monitoring solutions are recommended for production environments:

- **Azure Monitor workbooks**: Track Traffic Manager queries, Azure Front Door requests, Application Gateway health. For more information, see [Workbooks overview](/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview).

- **Outside-in monitoring to detect global Azure Front Door issues**: Implement outside-in global synthetic monitoring solutions (such as Catchpoint or ThousandEyes) to monitor endpoints. Services like [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/) offer a free alternative that provides limited global visibility.

- **Application Insights availability tests**: Multi-region HTTP checks. For more information, see [Availability testing](/azure/azure-monitor/app/availability-overview).

- **DNS monitoring**: Validate CNAME resolution chain and TTL propagation via DNSPerf, Pingdom, or Uptime.com.

- **Certificate monitoring**: For more information, see [SSL Labs Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/).
