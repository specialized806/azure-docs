# Monitor BlobFuse mount activities and resource usage

Health monitor is a tool that you use to monitor mount activities and resource usage. This article describes what data you can obtain, and how to enable health monitor and view output reports.

## Health monitor data

The BlobFuse Health monitor provides these specialized health monitors: _BlobFuse stats_, _CPU profiler_, _Memory profiler_, and _File cache monitor_.

The following table describes each of these monitors and the data that you can obtain from them.

| Health monitor     | Data available                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| File cache monitor | <li>Monitor the different events such as create, delete, rename, and chmod of files and directories in the cache</li><li>Keep track of the cache consumption with respect to the cache size specified during mounting</li> |

## Enable health monitor

You can enable the health monitor by modifying the BlobFuse configuration file. The following example shows sample configuration entries in the BlobFuse configuration file. In this example, the file cache monitor and the memory profiler are disabled.

```yaml
health_monitor:
  enable-monitoring: true
  stats-poll-interval-sec: 10
  process-monitor-interval-sec: 30
  output-path: outputReportsPath
  monitor-disable-list:
    - file_cache_monitor
    - memory_profiler
```

The following table describes each configuration field.

| Field | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| `enable-monitoring` | Boolean parameter to enable health monitor. By default, health monitor is disabled. |
| `stats-poll-interval-sec`| BlobFuse stats polling interval (in seconds). Default is 10 seconds. |
| `process-monitor-interval-sec`| CPU and memory usage polling interval expressed in seconds. Default is 30 seconds. |
| `output-path`| The path where health monitor generates its output file. It uses the current directory as the default if not specified. Output file name is `monitor_<pid>.json`. |
| `monitor-disable-list` | List of monitors to disable. To disable a monitor, add its corresponding name to the list. |
| `blobfuse_stats` | Disable BlobFuse stats polling |
| `cpu_profiler` | Disable CPU monitoring on the BlobFuse process |
| `memory_profiler` | Disable memory monitoring on the BlobFuse process |
| `file_cache_monitor` | Disable file cache directory monitor |

> [!NOTE]
> Health monitor runs as a separate process where one health monitor process is associated with monitoring one BlobFuse mounted directory.

## Output reports

Health monitor stores its output reports in the path specified in the `output-path` configuration option. If you don't specify this option, it uses the current directory as the default. It stores the last 100 MB of monitor data in 10 different files named `monitor_<pid>_<index>.json`, where `monitor_<pid>.json` (zeroth index) is the latest and `monitor_<pid>_9.json` is the oldest output file.

The following JSON shows an example of the output file contents.

```

    "Timestamp": "t1",
    "CPUUsage": "value in %",
    "MemoryUsage": "value in bytes",
    "BlobfuseStats": [

            }
        }
    ],

            "cacheEvent": "CREATE",
            "path": "filePath",
            "isDir": false,
            "cacheSize": value in bytes,
            "cacheConsumed": "value in %",
            "cacheFilesCount": count of files in cache,
            "evictedFilesCount": count of files evicted from cache,
            "value": {
                "FileSize": "value in bytes"
            }
        }
