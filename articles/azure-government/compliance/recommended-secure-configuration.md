# Secure Configuration Guide

FedRAMP Rev 5 has mandated the following Secure Configuration Guide requirements for all Cloud Service Providers at [Secure Configuration Guide](https://www.fedramp.gov/docs/rev5/balance/secure-configuration-guide/).

Azure provides the instructions and guidelines for the customers to meet these requirements. 

## Recommended secure configuration

This section includes a copy of the [Recommended Secure Configuration](https://www.fedramp.gov/docs/rev5/balance/secure-configuration-guide/#recommended-secure-configuration) from the Secure Configuration Guide and the recommendation and instructions for Azure.

### SCG-CSO-RSC 

Providers must create, maintain, and make available recommendations to securely configure their cloud services (this Secure Configuration Guide), which includes at least the following information:

- Required: Instructions on how to securely access, configure, operate, and decommission top-level administrative accounts that control enterprise access to the entire cloud service offering.
- Required: Explanations of security-related settings that can be operated only by top-level administrative accounts and their security implications.
- Recommended: Explanations of security-related settings that can be operated only by privileged accounts and their security implications.

>[!Note]
>- These requirements and recommendations refer to this guidance as a Secure Configuration Guide but cloud service providers may make this guidance available in various appropriate forms that provide the best customer experience.
>
>- This guidance should explain how top-level administrative accounts are named and referred to in the cloud service offering.

### Azure response with recommendation and instructions

Azure supports all the requirements outlined in SCG-CSO-RSC above and the following details.

Azure defines the following top-level administrative accounts.

|     Category                  |     Account   Type                     |     Why   It’s Top‑Level                                           |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     Tenant‑wide               |     Global Administrator (Microsoft Entra ID)    |     Full identity and directory control                            |
|                               |     Privileged Role Administrator      |     Can assign all privileged roles, including Global Administrator        |
|                               |     Emergency Access Accounts          |     Break‑glass, unrestricted access for outages                   |
|     Enterprise Agreement    |     Enterprise Administrator           |     Controls all Azure accounts and billing under the Enterprise Agreement           |
|                               |     Account Owner                      |     Creates subscriptions; controls subscription‑level admins    |
|     Subscription‑level        |     Service Administrator              |     Full management permissions on each subscription               |


**SCG-CSO-RSC Requirement:** Instructions about how to securely access, configure, operate, and decommission top-level administrative accounts that control enterprise access to the entire cloud service offering. 

Azure publishes authoritative guidance for top-level admin roles via Microsoft Learn (Microsoft Entra documentation), including privileged role definitions, emergency access ("break-glass") account guidance, and FedRAMP High identity access controls. For more information, see [RBAC and Directory Admin Roles](/role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles).

Microsoft Learn documents the built‑in administrative roles that are authorized to change tenant‑wide security settings, including:

- Global Administrator
- Security Administrator
- Conditional Access Administrator
- Privileged Role Administrator

These roles have the ability to alter authentication requirements, disable protections, and grant or revoke privileged access, making their governance critical.

Azure provides guidance to protect administrator sign-in, enforce MFA, conditional access, and protected admin workstations which detail how to securely access top-level administrative accounts in Azure. For more information, see [Privileged roles and permissions](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/privileged-roles-permissions).

Azure defines critical roles (Global/Privileged Role Admin), separation of duties, least‑privilege configuration and provides guidance to manage emergency access admin accounts in Entra ID – Guidance on creating and managing highly privileged “break-glass” global admin accounts (for emergency scenarios) to securely configure top-level administrative accounts with instructions to implement at [Microsoft cloud security benchmark – Privileged access](/security/benchmark/azure/mcsb-privileged-access) and [Azure identity & access security best practices](/azure/security/fundamentals/identity-management-best-practices).

Azure provides operational guardrails for privileged sessions, access reviews, activation workflows, and monitoring to securely operate top-level administrative accounts as well as lifecycle guidance to remove stale assignments and revoke credentials with least standing privilege to securely decommission (retire) top‑level administrative accounts.

Azure documents the impact of enabling MFA, PIM eligibility, conditional access, and session controls for admins to explain security-related settings for top-level administrative accounts.

Azure uses Risk‑based rationale for restricting privileged roles and avoiding persistent elevation to explain security implications of privileged account configuration choices. 

Instructions to implement the above are explained at [Secure access practices for administrators (Entra ID)](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/security-planning) and [Microsoft cloud security benchmark – Privileged access](/security/benchmark/azure/mcsb-privileged-access)


SCG-CSO-RSC Requirement: Explanations of security-related settings that can be operated only by top-level administrative accounts and their security implications.

SCG-CSO-RSC Recommendation: Explanations of security-related settings that can be operated only by privileged accounts and their security implications.

Microsoft Learn publicly documents tenant‑wide identity and access security settings that are **operated only by top‑level administrative roles** (for example, Global Administrator, Privileged Role Administrator, Conditional Access Administrator). These settings have direct and significant security implications because they control how privileged accounts authenticate, how legacy attack paths are blocked, and how identity risk is mitigated across the tenant. The security settings are described below.

#### 1. Security defaults (tenant‑wide secure‑by‑default controls)

Security Defaults are Microsoft‑recommended tenant‑wide protections that enforce a baseline identity security posture. These controls are **enabled, disabled, and governed by top‑level administrative roles**.

Security Defaults enforce:

- Multifactor authentication (MFA) for administrators
- MFA registration for all users
- Blocking of legacy authentication protocols
- Protection of privileged access to administrative portals

**Microsoft Learn:** [Security defaults in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/fundamentals/security-defaults)

#### 2. Blocking legacy authentication (tenant‑wide risk reduction)

Legacy authentication protocols (for example, IMAP, POP, SMTP AUTH) do not support modern protections such as MFA and are a primary entry point for account compromise. Microsoft documents blocking legacy authentication as a **critical tenant‑wide security control**.

Only privileged administrators can enforce blocking of legacy authentication through Security Defaults or Conditional Access policies.

Microsoft Learn documents that these controls significantly reduce common identity attacks such as password spray and phishing.

**Microsoft Learn:** [Security defaults in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/fundamentals/security-defaults)

#### 3. Conditional Access (tenant‑wide policy enforcement engine)

Conditional Access is Microsoft’s primary tenant‑wide policy engine for enforcing:

- MFA for privileged roles
- Risk‑based access controls
- Blocking insecure authentication paths
- Enforcement of Zero Trust principles

Conditional Access policies can only be created and modified by **privileged administrative roles**, and misconfiguration or absence of these policies materially increases identity compromise risk.

**Microsoft Learn:** [Plan a Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication deployment](/entra/identity/authentication/howto-mfa-getstarted)

#### 4. Emergency access ("break‑glass") accounts

Microsoft documents emergency access accounts as highly privileged accounts designed for tenant recovery when normal administrative access is unavailable. These accounts:

- Are configured only by top‑level administrators
- Bypass certain tenant‑wide controls by design
- Require strict monitoring and governance due to elevated risk

**Microsoft Learn:**  [Manage emergency access accounts in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/security-emergency-access)

#### 5. Identity Protection (Tenant‑Wide Risk Policies)

Microsoft Entra ID Protection provides tenant‑wide risk detection and enforcement for:

- Risky users
- Risky sign‑ins
- Automated remediation actions

Privileged administrators configure these policies, which directly protect high‑value and administrative accounts from compromise.

## Use instructions

This section includes a copy of the [Use Instructions](https://www.fedramp.gov/docs/rev5/balance/secure-configuration-guide/#use-instructions) from the Secure Configuration Guide and a response for Azure.

### SCG-CSO-AUP

Providers must include instructions in the FedRAMP authorization package that explain how to obtain and use the Secure Configuration Guide.

>[!Note] 
>These instructions may appear in a variety of ways; it's up to the provider to do so in the most appropriate and effective ways for their specific customer needs.

### Azure response

Azure supports SCG-CSO-AUP by including Azure's response to the Secure Configuration Guide usage in the FedRAMP authorization packages. Customers can request Azure's FedRAMP authorization package at [Federal Compliance Documentation](/azure/azure-government/compliance/azure-services-in-fedramp-auditscope#federal-compliance-documentation)

[Back to the top](#secure-configuration-guide)

## Public guidance

This section includes a copy of the [Public Guidance](https://www.fedramp.gov/docs/rev5/balance/secure-configuration-guide/#public-guidance) from the Secure Configuration Guide and a response for Azure.

### SCG-CSO-PUB

Providers should make the Secure Configuration Guide available publicly.

### Azure response

This article is the Azure Secure Configuration Guide and it is available publicly.

[Back to the top](#secure-configuration-guide)

## Secure defaults

This section includes a copy of the [Secure Defaults](https://www.fedramp.gov/docs/rev5/balance/secure-configuration-guide/#secure-defaults) from the Secure Configuration Guide and a response for Azure.

### SCG-CSO-SDF

Providers should set all settings to their recommended secure defaults for top-level administrative accounts and privileged accounts when initially provisioned.

### Azure response

Azure supports SCG-CSO-SDF and applies secure defaults for top-level administrative accounts and privileged accounts at provisioning via policy initiatives, security baselines, and baseline-as-code applied through automation. Azure sets security‑hardened defaults the moment a tenant, subscription, or administrative role is created.

When the tenant is first provisioned Azure enforces the below ensuring newly created admin or high‑privilege accounts never start in a weak or misconfigured state.

- **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)** eligibility, not permanent assignment
- **Multi‑Factor Authentication (MFA)** required for all privileged accounts
- **Conditional Access** controls (device requirements, session controls)
- Configure two break-glass accounts with restricted usage and continuous monitoring
- Alignment to **Azure Policy** + **Defender for Cloud** FedRAMP initiatives

When identities, subscriptions, or resources are created, **Security defaults** + **Conditional Access** give a hardened starting posture; **Azure Policy** applies baseline guardrails at MG/sub scopes so new assets inherit secure defaults automatically.

## Enhanced capabilities

The next sections are copied from the [Enhanced Capabilities](https://www.fedramp.gov/docs/rev5/balance/secure-configuration-guide/#enhanced-capabilities) in the Secure Configuration Guide and they include a response for Azure.

These recommendations apply to all cloud service offerings in the FedRAMP Marketplace for enhanced capabilities related to the Secure Configuration Guide.

### Comparison capability

This section includes a copy of the [Comparison Capability](https://www.fedramp.gov/docs/rev5/balance/secure-configuration-guide/#comparison-capability) from the Secure Configuration Guide and a response for Azure.

#### SCG-ENH-CMP

Providers SHOULD offer the capability to compare all current settings for top-level administrative accounts and privileged accounts to the recommended secure defaults.

#### Azure response

Azure supports SCG-ENH-CMP through built‑in security baseline comparison capabilities across **Microsoft Entra ID** top-level and privileged accounts and tenant‑level security settings.

Azure provides multiple mechanisms that allow customers to compare the current configuration of top-level and privileged identities against Microsoft’s published secure‑by‑default baseline. Azure provides built‑in comparison tools—Secure Score, Microsoft Entra ID Protection, Privileged Identity Management (PIM), Access Reviews, and Defender for Cloud—that continuously evaluate the configuration of all top-level and privileged accounts against Microsoft’s published secure-by-default identity baselines. These services surface deviations, provide gap analyses, and supply prescriptive remediation guidance, ensuring customers can easily compare current settings to recommended secure defaults at any time.

#### How Azure fulfills comparison capability

##### 1. Microsoft Entra ID Protection Baseline

- Microsoft publishes secure configuration baselines for identity.
- Microsoft Entra compares current tenant settings—including MFA enforcement, risky sign‑in detection, password protection, and conditional access posture—against Microsoft's recommended defaults.
- Deviations surface as alerts or "unmet recommendations".

**Microsoft Learn:**

- [Risk Detection Types](/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks)
  
##### 2. Microsoft Secure Score

Secure Score automatically evaluates:

- Privileged roles assigned
- MFA status for all privileged accounts
- Conditional Access configurations for admins
- Standing vs. Just‑in‑Time privilege (Privileged Identity Management)

Each control includes:

- Recommended default configuration
- Current configuration
- Gap analysis
- Remediation guidance
  
This directly supports the requirement to compare *all current settings* against recommended defaults.  

**Microsoft Learn:** [Microsoft Entra Identity Secure Score](/entra/identity/monitoring-health/concept-identity-secure-score)

##### 3. Microsoft Entra ID Access Reviews

- Reviews can be conducted specifically on:

  - **Global Administrators**
  - **Privileged Role Administrators**
  - **Any highly privileged custom role**
  
- Review results show:

  - Who currently has access
  - Whether access conforms to least privilege and Azure’s recommended defaults
  - Whether administrators maintain unnecessary standing rights
  
**Microsoft Learn:**
    
- [What are Access Reviews?](/entra/id-governance/access-reviews-overview)
- [Manage access with Access Reviews](/entra/id-governance/manage-access-review)
    
##### 4. Privileged Identity Management (PIM) policy comparison

PIM provides a built‑in control comparison:

- Shows whether default protections (approval, MFA-on-activation, time-bound privilege) are enabled.
- Highlights discrepancies between your configuration and Microsoft’s baseline.
