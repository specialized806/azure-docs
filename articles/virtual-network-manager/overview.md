# What is Azure Virtual Network Manager?

Azure Virtual Network Manager is a centralized management service that enables you to group, configure, deploy, and manage virtual networks globally across subscriptions and tenants. As organizations scale their cloud infrastructure, managing multiple virtual networks across different regions and subscriptions becomes increasingly complex. Azure Virtual Network Manager addresses this challenge by providing a unified pane of glass for network administration.

By using Virtual Network Manager, you can define network groups to identify and logically segment your virtual networks. Then you can determine the connectivity, security, and routing configurations you want and apply them across all the selected virtual networks in network groups at once, ensuring consistent network policies across your entire infrastructure. You can also use Virtual Network Manager's capabilities to manage your organization's IP address space and democratize simple network connectivity troubleshooting.

## How does Azure Virtual Network Manager work?

:::image type="content" source="./media/overview/management-group.png" alt-text="Diagram of management group, subscription, and virtual network hierarchy in Virtual Network Manager.":::

During the creation process, you define the scope for what your Azure Virtual Network Manager instance, or *network manager*, manages. Your network manager only has the delegated access for resource visibility, configuration deployment, and IP address management within this scope boundary. You can define a scope directly over a list of subscriptions. You can also use [management groups](../governance/management-groups/overview.md) to define your scope. Management groups provide hierarchical organization to your subscriptions. After defining your network manager's scope, you can deploy configuration types including *Connectivity*, *Security admin*, and *Routing* across grouped network resources within this scope. You can also use the network manager to manage your organization's IP address space and troubleshoot reachability issues across the Azure network resources within your network manager's scope.

After you deploy the network manager, you create a *network group*, which serves as a logical container of networking resources to apply configurations at scale. You can manually select individual virtual networks to add to your network group, or you can use Azure Policy to define conditions that govern your group membership dynamically. For more information about Azure Policy initiatives, see [Network groups and Azure Policy](concept-network-groups.md#network-groups-and-azure-policy).

Next, you create configurations to apply to those network groups based on your topology and security needs. A [connectivity configuration](concept-connectivity-configuration.md) enables you to create a mesh or a hub-and-spoke network topology using your network groups. A [security admin configuration](concept-security-admins.md) allows you to define a collection of security admin rules that you can apply onto one or more network groups, programming those rules across your virtual networks globally. A [routing configuration](concept-user-defined-route.md) lets you describe and orchestrate [user-defined routes](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview.md) at scale to control traffic flow according to your desired routing behavior. 

Once you create your desired network groups and configurations, you can deploy the configurations to any region of your choosing. **Configurations don't take effect until you deploy them to regions containing your target network resources.**

You can deploy and manage Azure Virtual Network Manager through the [Azure portal](./create-virtual-network-manager-portal.md), [Azure CLI](./create-virtual-network-manager-cli.md), [Azure PowerShell](./create-virtual-network-manager-powershell.md), [Bicep](./create-virtual-network-manager-bicep.md), or [Terraform](./create-virtual-network-manager-terraform.md).

## Key benefits

- **Centralized management**: Manage connectivity and security policies globally across regions and subscriptions from a single portal, reducing administrative overhead and ensuring consistency.

- **Simplified hub-and-spoke connectivity**: Enable direct connectivity between spoke virtual networks in a hub-and-spoke configuration without the complexity of managing a mesh network or manually configuring extra peerings.

- **Enterprise-grade reliability**: Azure Virtual Network Manager is a highly scalable and highly available service with redundancy and replication across the globe.

- **Advanced security controls**: Create network security rules that are evaluated before network security group rules, providing granular control over traffic flow with global enforcement capabilities.

- **Optimized performance**: Low latency and high bandwidth between resources in different virtual networks using virtual network peering.

- **Flexible deployment**: Roll out network changes through a specific region sequence and frequency of your choosing for controlled and safe network updates and rollbacks.

- **Cost optimization**: Reduce operational costs by automating network management tasks and eliminating the need for complex custom scripting solutions.

- **Centralized IP address management**: Manage your organization's IP address space by automatically allocating non-overlapping IP address space from IP address pools to prevent address space conflicts across on-premises and multicloud environments.

- **Reachability verification**: Validate Azure network policies and troubleshoot connectivity issues by analyzing reachability paths between Azure resources and identifying Azure policies and configurations disallowing network traffic.

## Regions

For current information on the regions where Azure Virtual Network Manager is available, see [Azure products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/table) and search for *Azure Virtual Network Manager* to see the list of supported regions.

## Pricing
   
For pricing details, see the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/) and estimate your usage of Azure Virtual Network Manager based on your organization's needs.

New Azure Virtual Network Manager instances charge only on the virtual network-based pricing described in the pricing page.

Azure Virtual Network Manager instances created before the release of the virtual network-based pricing continue to charge on the subscription-based pricing described in the pricing page. If you prefer for your Azure Virtual Network Manager instance to instead charge on the virtual network-based pricing, follow these steps to switch its pricing model through Azure Feature Exposure Control (AFEC).

1. In the Azure portal, search for **Preview features**.
1. On the **Preview Features** page, ensure the subscription selected is the subscription that contains your Azure Virtual Network Manager instance. Filter the features by *Network manager*.
1. Select the feature named **Network manager billing by virtual networks** and register. The Azure Virtual Network Manager instance in the registered subscription now charges on the virtual network-based pricing.

> [!NOTE]
> This virtual network-based pricing is [generally available](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/?id=480669). Its enablement mechanism is available through AFEC for ease of setup and because the previous subscription-based pricing isn't yet retired. The subscription-based pricing announces its retirement to pre-existing Azure Virtual Network Manager customers on February 6, 2025, and retires fully in February 6, 2028. Any Azure Virtual Network Manager instances still using the subscription-based pricing after February 6, 2028, automatically switch to the virtual network-based pricing.
