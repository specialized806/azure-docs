# Microsoft Dev Box roadmap

[!INCLUDE [note-windows-365-announcement](includes/note-windows-365-announcement.md)]

This roadmap presents a set of planned feature releases that underscores Microsoft's commitment to deliver the most secure and productive developer experience from the cloud. This feature list offers a glimpse into our plans for the next six months, highlighting key features we're developing. It's not exhaustive but shows major investments. Some features might release as previews and evolve based on your feedback before becoming generally available. We always listen to your input, so the timing, design, and delivery of some features might change.

Key Dev Box deliverables can be grouped under the following themes:

- Enterprise management

- Fundamental performance & reliability

## Enterprise management

Microsoft Dev Box aims to deliver centralized governance based on organizational standards for security, compliance, and cost controls. During this period, we're reducing the time it takes enterprises to get started with Dev Box by making it easier to set up a proof of concept (POC) and then move to production. We're also improving our monitoring, cost control, security, and privacy capabilities.

**Streamlined and flexible onboarding for enterprises**

- [On-behalf creation](https://developercommunity.microsoft.com/t/On-behalf-creation-of-machines/10859734): As a dev center admin, you'll be able to provision a Dev Box machine for other developers in your team.

**Network setup and expansion**

- [Expand IPs within existing subnets](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Expand-IPs-within-existing-Subnets-in-a/10781464): As a dev center admin, you'll be able to expand IP ranges in subnets that are running out of IP addresses.

**Security and privacy**

- [Developer offboarding](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Provide-a-means-to-do-external-cleanup/10670632?q=delete+unused+): As a dev center admin, configure your Dev Box service to offload users from the service when they leave the organization and switch between teams.

## Fundamental performance & reliability

Microsoft Dev Box aims to provide a "like-local" developer experience that is as responsive and seamless as working on a local machine. We're continually enhancing the reliability, speed, and performance of Dev Box by optimizing everything from your favorite Visual Studio development tools to Windows, RDP, and the location of Dev Box machines.

**Seamless and reliable connectivity**

- [Single Sign On (SSO) for existing Dev Box machines](https://developercommunity.microsoft.com/t/Single-Sign-On-SSO-for-existing-Dev-Bo/10859770): As a dev center admin, you'll be able to enable Single Sign On experience for already existing Dev Box machines.

- [Auto Remediation Improvements](https://developercommunity.microsoft.com/t/Network-connection-auto-remediation/10861428): As a developer, you won't be blocked from connecting to your Dev Box machine due to networking issues. Autoremediation of connectivity issues should allow you to connect to your machine.

- [Latency Improvements](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Latency-improvements-when-using-a-mouse/10859786): As a developer you'll experience reduced mouse latency with high-resolution monitors along with other generic latency improvements.

**Service health & reliability**

- [Backup SKUs:](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Back-up-SKUs-in-case-of-capacity-outage/10720451) As a developer, you'll be able to smoothly resume working on existing Dev Box machines during service outages by opting to using a fallback SKU.

This roadmap outlines our current priorities, and we remain flexible to adapt based on customer feedback. We invite you to [share your thoughts and suggest more capabilities you would like to see](https://aka.ms/DevBox/Feedback). Your insights help us refine our focus and deliver even greater value.
