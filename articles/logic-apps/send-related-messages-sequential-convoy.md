# Send related Service Bus messages in a specific order by using a sequential convoy in Azure Logic Apps

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard](../../includes/logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard.md)]

Some scenarios require your workflow to process session-related messages in a specific order from an Azure Service Bus [queue](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-queues-topics-subscriptions.md). These messages have a property that defines the relationship with each other, such as a [*session* ID](../service-bus-messaging/message-sessions.md). To process these messages by session, set up a [*sequential convoy* pattern](/azure/architecture/patterns/sequential-convoy) in your workflow.

For example, suppose you have a Service Bus queue that receives messages from multiple sessions. You have 10 messages from a session named *Session 1* and 5 messages from a session named *Session 2*. You can create a workflow that alternates between sessions to process messages from the queue. When the trigger first fires, the workflow run handles all the messages from Session 1. When the trigger fires again, the workflow run handles all the messages from Session 2.

:::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/sequential-convoy-pattern-general.png" alt-text="Diagram shows the general sequential convoy pattern.":::

This guide shows how to create a workflow that sets up the sequential convoy pattern to perform the following high-level steps:

1. When the Service Bus trigger named **When a message is received in a queue (peek-lock)** fires, run the workflow.

   For more information about *peek-lock* mode, see [Receive modes](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-queues-topics-subscriptions.md#receive-modes) and [Peek lock](../service-bus-messaging/message-transfers-locks-settlement.md#peeklock).

1. Initialize a session based on the message that the trigger reads from the Service Bus queue.

1. Read and process all the messages from the same session in the queue during the current workflow run.

For Standard logic apps, you can create a workflow by using the template named **Azure Service Bus: Process related messages from a session-enabled queue for the same workflow instance - Sequential convoy pattern**.

For Consumption workflows, no workflow template is available in the designer, so you have to manually build the workflow. You can also review the template for Standard workflows or the JSON file for the formerly available template named **Correlated in-order delivery using service bus sessions** available in [GitHub: service-bus-sessions.json](https://github.com/Azure/logicapps/blob/master/templates/service-bus-sessions.json).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account and subscription. [Get a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).

- A Service Bus namespace (Standard or Premium pricing tier) and a Service Bus *session-enabled* queue.

  - These items and your logic app resource must use the same Azure subscription.

  - When you create your queue, make sure that you select **Enable sessions**.

  For more information, see [Create a Service Bus namespace and queue](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-create-namespace-portal.md).

- The logic app resource where you want to set up the sequential convoy pattern.

  For more information, see:

  - [Create a Consumption logic app workflow](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-example-consumption-workflow.md)
  - [Create a Standard logic app workflow](../logic-apps/create-single-tenant-workflows-azure-portal.md)

  Your logic app resource also needs permissions to your Service Bus namespace. To check these permissions, see [Check access to Service Bus namespace](#permissions-connection-strong).

<a name="permissions-connection-string"></a>

## Check access to Service Bus namespace

Your logic app resource and workflow need permissions to access your Service Bus namespace. If you're unsure whether your workflow has permissions, check them now.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), find and select your Service Bus namespace.

1. On the sidebar menu, under **Settings**, select **Shared access policies**. Check that you have **Manage** permissions for that namespace.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/check-service-bus-permissions.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Shared access policies page for a Service Bus namespace." lightbox="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/check-service-bus-permissions.png":::

1. Get the connection string for your Service Bus namespace by following these steps:

   1. On the **Shared access policies** page, under **Policy**, select **RootManageSharedAccessKey**.
   
   1. On the **SAS Policy: RootManageSharedAccessKey** pane, next to the primary connection string, select the copy button.

      :::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/copy-service-bus-connection-string.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Shared access policies where you can copy a Service Bus namespace connection string.":::

      > [!TIP]
      >
      > To make sure that your connection string is associated with your Service Bus namespace and not a messaging entity, such as a queue, check the connection string for the `EntityPath` parameter. If you find this parameter, the connection string is for a specific entity, and isn't the correct string to use with your workflow.

   1. Save the connection string for later use when you connect from your workflow to the namespace.

## Create a sequential convoy workflow

Based on whether your logic app resource is Standard or Consumption, follow the corresponding steps.

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

These steps create a workflow from the template named **Azure Service Bus: Process related messages from a session-enabled queue for the same workflow instance - Sequential convoy pattern**. The template includes the trigger and actions to implement this workflow pattern. You also create a connection to your Service Bus namespace and specify the name for the Service Bus queue that you want to use.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Standard logic app resource.

1. On the sidebar menu, under **Workflows**, select **Workflows**.

1. On the **Workflows** toolbar, select **Create** > **Create from Template**.

1. Under **Templates**, select the template named **Azure Service Bus: Process related messages from a session-enabled queue for the same workflow instance - Sequential convoy pattern**, and then select **Use this template**.

   The following example partially shows the workflow templates gallery:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/select-workflow-template.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows a page where you can select a service bus sessions template." lightbox="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/select-workflow-template.png":::

1. On the **Create a new workflow from template** pane, follow these steps:

   1. On the **Basics** tab, follow these steps:

      1. Enter a name for your workflow.

         The name must start with a letter and can contain only letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores.

      1. Select **Stateful** or **Stateless**, based on your scenario.

      1. Select **Next**.

   1. On the **Connections** tab, follow these steps:

      1. For Service Bus, in the **Connection** column, select **Connect**.

         :::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/connect-service-bus.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows pane to start connecting to Azure Service Bus namespace.":::

      1. Provide the following information:

         | Parameter | Value | Description |
         |-----------|-------|-------------|
         | **Connection Name** | <*connection-name*> | The name for the connection to your Service Bus namespace. |
         | **Authentication Type** | **Connection String** | The authentication type to use. |
         | **Connection String** | <*namespace-connection-string*> | The connection string that you saved earlier from your Service Bus namespace. |

          :::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/service-bus-connection-standard.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Service Bus connection pane in Standard workflow":::

      1. When you're done, select **Add connection** > **Next**.

   1. On the **Parameters** tab, follow these steps:

      1. Provide the following information:

         | Parameter | Description |
         |-----------|-------------|
         | **Queue name** | The name for the Service Bus session-enabled queue with the messages to process. |
         | **Maximum batch size** | The maximum number of messages to get as a batch. |

      1. When you're done, select **Next**.

   1. Review the provided information, and select **Create**.

   The designer shows a workflow prepopulated with the trigger named **When messages are available in a queue (peek-lock)** and various actions, for example:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/workflow-from-template.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows workflow with all operations.":::

   This workflow includes predefined cross-environment parameters to abstract values that change across various environments where your workflow runs, such as development, test, and production. Many operations in the workflow use these parameters instead of hardcoded values.

   The following table describes these cross-environment parameters:

   | Name | Type | Value | Description |
   |------|------|-------|-------------|
   | `delayInMinutes_<workflow-name>` | **Integer** | `0` | The number of minutes to wait before renewing the message lock token. |
   | `messageBatchSize_<workflow-name>` | **Integer** | `50` | The number of messages for the current batch. |
   | `queueName_<workflow-name>` | **String** | `<Service-Bus-queue-name>` | The name for your Service Bus queue. |

   For more information, see [Create cross-environment parameters for workflow inputs](create-parameters-workflows.md).

1. To learn about the predefined operations in the workflow, continue to the next section.

#### Workflow operations

The following sections describe the predefined operations in the workflow.

##### When messages are available in a queue (peek-lock)

This Azure Service Bus built-in trigger waits for one or more messages to arrive in a specified Service Bus queue. If a message exists in the queue, the trigger fires and runs a workflow instance. The term *peek-lock* means that the trigger sends a request to retrieve a message from the queue. If a message exists, the trigger retrieves and locks the message so that no other processing happens on that message until the lock period expires. The trigger also outputs a [ServiceBusMessage object](/connectors/servicebus/#servicebusmessage).

The following table describes the prepopulated trigger parameters:

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Queue name** | `queueName_<workflow-name>` | The predefined cross-environment parameter that specifies your Service Bus queue. To set this value, follow these steps: <br><br>1. Select inside the **Queue name** box, and then select the lightning icon to open the dynamic content list. <br>2. From the list, select `queueName_<workflow-name>`. |
| **Queue type** | **Main** | This default type refers to your primary Service Bus queue. |
| **Maximum message batch size** | `messageBatchSize_<workflow-name>` | The predefined cross-environment parameter that specifies the largest number of messages in a batch. To set this value, follow these steps: <br><br>1. Select inside the **Maximum message batch size** box, and then select the lightning icon to open the dynamic content list. <br>2. From the list, select `messageBatchSize_<workflow-name>`. |

For more information, see [**When messages are available in a queue (peek-lock)**](azure/logic-apps/connectors/built-in/reference/servicebus/#when-messages-are-available-in-a-queue-(peek-lock)).

##### Initialize Process Complete Flag

This [**Initialize variable** action](logic-apps-create-variables-store-values.md#initialize-variable) named **Initialize Process Complete Flag** creates a variable with the following initial values:

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | `processCompleted` | The name for the variable. |
| **Type** | **Boolean** | The data type for the variable. |
| **Value** | **false** | The default value for the variable. |

The `processCompleted` variable's value changes to `true` during workflow execution later when the following conditions become true:

- No more messages exist in the session for processing.
- The session lock no longer needs to be renewed so the current workflow instance can finish running.

##### Scope action

The outer parent [**Scope** action](logic-apps-control-flow-run-steps-group-scopes.md) contains an inner nested **Scope** action named **Business Logic Scope**. This nested scope contains a placeholder action named **Business Logic**. Here, you can add the actions for your scenario's business logic to process the current message.

1. For clarity, rename the outer parent [**Scope** action](logic-apps-control-flow-run-steps-group-scopes.md) to `Process message`.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/rename-parent-scope.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the parent scope renamed as Process message.":::

1. Expand the inner nested action named **Business Logic Scope**.

   If a problem happens in this scope, use the subsequent actions outside the parent **Scope** action to handle that problem.

1. Replace the **Business Logic** placeholder action with the actual actions for your scenario's business logic.

Under the **Business Logic Scope** action, the **Process Finished** action is set up to always run, regardless of the status assigned to the **Business Logic Scope** action after all the actions in the **Business Logic Scope** action finish running. For the **Process Finished** action to always run, the workflow presets the **Run after** setting to the following values:

- **Is successful**
- **Has timed out**
- **Is skipped**
- **Has failed**

:::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/run-after-settings-template.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Run after settings for the Process Finished action.":::

The **Process Finished** action changes the `processCompleted` variable value from **false** to **true**, which indicates that message processing finished.

:::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/process-finished-updated.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the updated values in the Process Finished action.":::

##### Until

At the **Business Logic Scope** level, a parallel branch runs an **Until** loop that determines whether any other messages exist in the same session. Actions run inside the loop until the loop condition is met or the timeout period elapses. In this example, the loop continues running until message processing finishes as expressed by the following condition:

`processCompleted = true`

:::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/parallel-branch-until-loop-standard.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the parallel branch with the Until loop.":::

##### Renew lock on a message in a queue

In the **Until** loop, the Service Bus action named **Renew lock on a message in a queue** controls the time that the workflow can process a message before the message becomes available again for processing. This behavior prevents premature release due to long-running tasks and makes sure that only one client handles the message at a time before setting the lock duration to the initial value. For more information, see [Renew locks](../service-bus-messaging/message-transfers-locks-settlement#renew-locks.md).

The following table describes the action's prepopulated parameters:

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Queue name** | `queueName_<workflow-name>` | The predefined cross-environment parameter that specifies your Service Bus queue. To set this value, follow these steps: <br><br>1. Select inside the **Queue name** box, and then select the lightning icon to open the dynamic content list. <br>2. From the list, select `queueName_<workflow-name>`. |
| **Lock token** | **Lock Token** | The lock token for the message to abandon. To set this value, follow these steps: <br><br>1. Select inside the **Lock token** box, and then select the lightning icon to open the dynamic content list. <br>2. From the list, under **When messages are available in a queue**, select `Lock Token`. |

##### Wait for Process to Complete

In the **Until** loop, the **Delay** action named **Wait for Process to Complete** adds an extra delay for message processing to complete. Make sure this delay value is less than the lock timeout duration for the queue. The minimum lock duration is 30 seconds.

The following table describes the action's prepopulated parameters:

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Count** | `delayInMinutes_<workflow-name>` | The predefined cross-environment parameter that specifies the number of minutes to wait before renewing the message lock token. To set this value, follow these steps: <br><br>1. Select inside the **Queue name** box, and then select the lightning icon to open the dynamic content list. <br>2. From the list, select `delayInMinutes_<workflow-name>`. |
| **Unit** | **Minute** | The time unit for the delay. |

##### Actions for post-message processing

Under the `Process message` scope, two parallel branches exist to handle the cases for unsuccessful and successful message processing.

- Branch 1

  This branch includes a **Compose** action named **Compensation Logic** as a placeholder for the actions you want to run for handling errors and exceptions.

  1. Replace this placeholder with the actions that you want instead.

     For example, you might set up a **Scope** action that contains your error handling actions.

  1. Make sure that the error-handling action directly under the `Process message` scope runs only after the `Process message` scope completes with one of the following statuses:

     - **Has timed out**
     - **Is skipped**
     - **Has failed**

     For example:

     :::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/error-handling-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows error handling scope and run after settings.":::

  Under the error-handling actions, the Service Bus action named **Abandon the message in a queue** unlocks a message and requeues the message for another attempt.

  The following table describes the action's prepopulated values:

  | Parameter | Value | Description |
  |-----------|-------|-------------|
  | **Queue name** | `queueName_<workflow-name>` | The predefined cross-environment parameter that specifies your Service Bus queue. To set this value, follow these steps: <br><br>1. Select inside the **Queue name** box, and then select the lightning icon to open the dynamic content list. <br>2. From the list, select `queueName_<workflow-name>`. |
  | **Lock token** | **Lock Token** | The lock token for the message to abandon. To set this value, follow these steps: <br><br>1. Select inside the **Lock token** box, and then select the lightning icon to open the dynamic content list. <br>2. From the list, under **When messages are available in a queue**, select `Lock Token`. |

  For example:

  :::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/abandon-message-standard.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Abandon message action for Standard workflow.":::

- Branch 2

  This branch includes a Service Bus action named **Complete the message in a queue** that marks the message as done and deletes the message from the queue. This behavior prevents redelivery and moves the message to "processed" status. This action runs only if the `Process message` scope successfully completes.

  The following table describes the action's prepopulated values:

  | Parameter | Value | Description |
  |-----------|-------|-------------|
  | **Queue name** | `queueName_<workflow-name>` | The predefined cross-environment parameter that specifies your Service Bus queue. To set this value, follow these steps: <br><br>1. Select inside the **Queue name** box, and then select the lightning icon to open the dynamic content list. <br>2. From the list, select `queueName_<workflow-name>`. |
  | **Lock token** | **Lock Token** | The lock token for the message to abandon. To set this value, follow these steps: <br><br>1. Select inside the **Lock token** box, and then select the lightning icon to open the dynamic content list. <br>2. From the list, under **When messages are available in a queue**, select `Lock Token`. |

  For example:

  :::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/complete-message-standard.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Complete message action for Standard workflow.":::

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

These steps manually create a workflow that uses an Azure Service Bus trigger and actions to implement the sequential convoy pattern. Your workflow creates a connection to your Service Bus namespace and specifies the name for the Service Bus queue that you want to use.

#### Add parameters to your workflow

In this section, create cross-environment parameters to abstract values that change across various environments where your workflow runs, such as development, test, and production. Later, you add various actions that use these parameters in your workflow.

Follow these [general steps](create-parameters-workflows.md) to create the cross-environment parameters in this table:

| Name | Type | Value | Description |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| `delayInMinutes_<workflow-name>` | **Integer** | `0` | The number of minutes to wait before renewing the message lock token. |
| `messageBatchSize_<workflow-name>` | **Integer** | `50` | The number of messages for the current batch. |
| `queueName_<workflow-name>` | **String** | `<Service-Bus-queue-name>` | The name for your Service Bus queue. |

When you're done, your cross-environment parameters look like the following example:

:::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/workflow-parameters.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows cross-environment parameters.":::

#### Add a Service Bus trigger

These steps add a Service Bus trigger that initializes sessions and checks the specified Service Bus queue for messages, based on the specified schedule. If a message exists in the queue, the trigger fires and runs the workflow.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Consumption logic app resource and blank workflow in the designer.

1. Follow the [general steps](add-trigger-action-workflow.md#add-trigger) to add a Service Bus trigger named **When one or more messages arrive in a queue (peek-lock)**.

   The term *peek-lock* means that the trigger sends a request to retrieve a message from the queue. If a message exists, the trigger retrieves and locks the message so that no other processing happens on that message until the lock period expires.

1. On the connection pane, provide the following information:

   | Parameter | Value | Description |
   |-----------|-------|-------------|
   | **Connection Name** | <*connection-name*> | The name for the connection to your Service Bus namespace. |
   | **Authentication Type** | **Access key** | The authentication type to use. |
   | **Connection String** | <*namespace-connection-string*> | The connection string that you saved earlier from your Service Bus namespace. |

   :::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/service-bus-connection-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Service Bus connection pane in Consumption workflow.":::

1. When you're done, select **Create new**.

1. After the trigger information pane opens, on the **Parameters** tab, provide the following values:

   1. Select inside the **Queue name** box, and then select the lightning icon to open the dynamic content list.

   1. From the list, select `queueName_<workflow-name>`.

      This previously created cross-environment parameter specifies the name for your Service Bus queue.

   1. For **Queue type**, keep the default type set to **Main**.

      This type refers to your primary Service Bus queue.

   1. Under **Advanced parameters**, for **Session id**, select **Next available**.

      The following table describes more information about the **Session id** values:

      | Session id | Description |
      |------------|------------|
      | **None** | The default value, which results in no sessions and can't be used for implementing the sequential convoy pattern. |
      | **Next available** | This value specifies that when the trigger fires, the trigger gets a session based on the session ID from the message in the Service Bus queue. The workflow's subsequent actions process all the messages associated with the same session. <br><br>The session is locked so that no other workflow or client can process messages related to the same session. |
      | **Enter custom value** | A known, static session ID that you want the trigger to always use. |

      > [!NOTE]
      >
      > The Service Bus connector can save a limited number of unique sessions at a time to the connector cache from Azure Service Bus. If the session count exceeds this limit, old sessions are removed from the cache. For more information, see [Exchange messages in the cloud with Azure Logic Apps and Azure Service Bus](../connectors/connectors-create-api-servicebus.md#connector-reference).

   1. Select inside the **Maximum message count** box, then select the lightning icon to open the dynamic content list.

   1. From the list, select `messageBatchSize_<workflow-name>`.

   The completed trigger looks like the following example:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/when-messages-arrive-trigger.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the completed Service Bus trigger.":::

   The trigger outputs a [ServiceBusMessage object](/connectors/servicebus/#servicebusmessage).

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > Initially, the polling interval is set to three minutes so that the logic app doesn't run more frequently than you expect and result in unanticipated billing charges. Ideally, set the interval and frequency to 30 seconds so that the logic app triggers immediately when a message arrives.

   For more information, see [Service Bus - When one or more messages arrive in a queue (peek-lock)](/connectors/servicebus/#when-one-or-more-messages-arrive-in-a-queue-(peek-lock)).

#### Add a variable to check whether more messages exist

To help your workflow determine whether any more messages from a session need processing, create a Boolean variable with the default value set to `false`. This variable indicates when the following conditions are true:

- No more messages exist in the session for processing.
- The session lock no longer needs to be renewed so the current workflow instance can finish running.

1. In the designer, under the trigger, follow the [general steps](add-trigger-action-workflow.md#add-action) to add a **Variables** action named **Initialize variables**.

1. Rename the action to `Initialize Process Complete Flag`.

1. In the action information pane, provide the following values:

   | Parameter | Value | Description |
   |-----------|-------|-------------|
   | **Name** | <*variable-name*> | The name for the variable. For this example, the name is `processCompleted`. |
   | **Type** | **Boolean** | The data type for the variable. |
   | **Value** | **false** | The initial default value for the variable. |

   When you're done, your workflow looks like the following example:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/initialize-process-complete.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the information for Vitalize Process Complete Flag.":::

   For more information, see [Initialize the session](#initialize-session).

1. Continue to the next section to add a scope for message handling.

#### Add actions to process each message

These steps add a [**Scope** action](logic-apps-control-flow-run-steps-group-scopes.md) to the workflow. Inside this **Scope** action, another scope contains the actions for message processing, based on your scenario's business logic. If a problem happens in these scopes, the actions outside the outermost **Scope** action handle that problem.

1. In the designer, under the `Initialize Process Complete Flag` action, follow the [general steps](add-trigger-action-workflow.md#add-action) to add a **Scope** action.

1. Rename the scope action to `Process message`, for example:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/process-message-scope.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the workflow with the Process Message scope.":::

1. In the **Process message** scope, add another **Scope** action.

   1. Change the second scope name to `Business Logic Scope`, for example:

      :::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/business-logic-scope.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the workflow with Business Logic Scope.":::

   1. Inside `Business Logic Scope`, add the actions to process the current message, based on your scenario's business logic.

1. Outside `Business Logic Scope`, add a **Variables** action named **Set variable**.

   1. Change **Set variable** to `Process Finished`.

   1. On the **Parameters** tab, provide the following information:

      | Parameter | Value | Description |
      |-----------|-------|-------------|
      | **Name** | <*variable-name*> | The name for the variable. For this example, the name is `processCompleted`. |
      | **Value** | **true** | The updated value to indicate that message processing completed. |

      When the message finishes processing, the `Processed Finished` action updates the value in the `processCompleted` variable from **false** to **true**.

   1. On the **Settings** tab, in the **Run after** section, expand **Business Logic Scope**.

   1. Select all the unselected statuses: **Has timed out**, **Is skipped**, and **Has failed**, for example:

      :::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/run-after-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the run after settings for Process Finished.":::

1. At the same level as the **Business Logic Scope**, add a parallel branch to determine whether any other messages exist in the same session.

   1. Between `Process message` and `Business Logic Scope`, select the plus sign (**+**), and then select **Add a parallel branch**.

   1. In the **Add an action** pane, add a **Control** action named **Until**, which is a type of loop, for example:

      :::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/parallel-branch-until-loop.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the parallel branch with the Until loop.":::

   1. On the **Until** action information pane, provide the condition that stops running the loop.

      This **Until** loop makes sure the session lock is held while messages exist or until one hour passes. To change the loop's time limit, edit the loop's advanced parameter named **Timeout**, which is set to **PT1H**.

      1. On the **Parameters** tab, select inside the leftmost **Choose a value** box, and then select the expression editor (function icon).

      1. In the expression editor, enter the following expression:

         `variables('processCompleted')`

      1. When you're done, select **Add**.

         The expression resolves, and the partially completed condition looks like the following example:

         :::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/process-completed-until-loop.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the resolved expression for processCompleted variable.":::

      1. In the middle list, make sure the operation is set to the equal sign (**=**).

      1. In the rightmost **Chose a value** box, enter the value `true`.

         The completed condition looks like the following example:

         :::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/until-loop-completed.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the completed Until loop.":::

   1. Add actions for message detection to the **Until** loop by following these steps:

      1. Follow the [general steps](add-trigger-action-workflow.md#add-action) to add a Service Bus action named **Renew lock on the message in a queue**.

         This action extends the time that the workflow can process a message before the message becomes available again for processing. This behavior prevents premature release due to long-running tasks and makes sure that only one client handles the messages at a time before letting the lock duration to the initial value. For more information, see [Renew locks](../service-bus-messaging/message-transfers-locks-settlement#renew-locks.md).

      1. After the Service Bus action information pane opens, provide the following values:

         1. Select inside the **Queue name** box, and then select the lightning icon to open the dynamic content list.

         1. From the list, select `queueName_<workflow-name>`.

         1. Select inside the **Lock token of the message** box, and then select the lightning icon to open the dynamic content list.

         1. From the list, under **When one or more messages arrive in a queue**, select **Lock Token**.

         The following example shows the completed Service Bus action:

         :::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/renew-lock-on-message-complete.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the completed renew lock action.":::

      1. Under the Service Bus action, add a **Schedule** action named **Delay**.

         1. Change the action name to `Wait for Process to Complete`.

         1. On the **Parameters** tab, the action information pane, select inside the **Count** box, and then select the lightning icon.

         1. From the list, select `delayInMinutes_<workflow-name>`.

            Make sure this delay value is less than the lock timeout duration for the queue. The minimum lock duration is 30 seconds.

         1. For **Unit**, set the time unit for the delay.

            This example uses **Minute**.

         The following example shows the completed delay duration:

         :::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/wait-process-complete.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the completed delay duration.":::

      When you're done, the **Until** loop looks like the following example:

      :::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/until-loop-actions.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the actions in the Until loop.":::

      [!INCLUDE [Warning about creating infinite loops](../../includes/connectors-infinite-loops.md)]

#### Add actions for post-message processing

Under the `Process message` scope, set up the following two branches:

- Branch 1

  1. Add the actions for handling errors and exceptions.

     For example, you might set up a **Scope** action that contains your error handling actions.

     Make sure that the error-handling action directly under the `Process message` scope runs only after the `Process message` scope completes with one of the following statuses:

     - **Has timed out**
     - **Is skipped**
     - **Has failed**

     For example:

     :::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/error-handling-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows error handling scope and run after settings.":::

  1. Under the error-handling actions, add the Service Bus action named **Abandon the message in a queue**, and then set up the action as follows:

     1. Select inside the **Queue name** box, and then select the lightning icon to open the dynamic content list.

     1. From the list, select `queueName_<workflow-name>`.

     1. Select inside the **Lock token of the message** box, and then select the lightning icon to open the dynamic content list.

     1. From the list, under **When one or more messages arrive in a queue**, select **Lock Token**.

     1. Select inside the **Session id** box, and then select the lightning icon to open the dynamic content list.

     1. From the list, under **When one or more messages arrive in a queue**, select **Session Id**.

     When you're done, the Service Bus action looks like the following example:

     :::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/abandon-message-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Abandon message in queue for Consumption workflow.":::

- Branch 2: Add the Service Bus action named **Complete the message in a queue**. This action runs only if the `Process message` scope successfully completes. Set up the action as follows:

  1. Select inside the **Queue name** box, and then select the lightning icon to open the dynamic content list.

  1. From the list, select `queueName_<workflow-name>`.

  1. Select inside the **Lock token of the message** box, and then select the lightning icon to open the dynamic content list.

  1. From the list, under **When one or more messages arrive in a queue**, select **Lock Token**.

  1. Select inside the **Session id** box, and then select the lightning icon to open the dynamic content list.

  1. From the list, under **When one or more messages arrive in a queue**, select **Session Id**.

  When you're done, the Service Bus action looks like the following example:

  :::image type="content" source="./media/send-related-messages-sequential-convoy/complete-message-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Complete message in queue for Consumption workflow.":::
