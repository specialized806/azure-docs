# Open an SSH session to a container in Azure App Service

[Secure Shell (SSH)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) can be used to execute administrative commands remotely to a container. App Service provides SSH support directly into an app hosted in a Windows custom container. 

Windows custom containers don't require any special settings for the [browser SSH session](#open-ssh-session-in-browser) to work.

[Secure Shell (SSH)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) can be used to execute administrative commands remotely to a container. App Service provides SSH support directly into an app hosted in a Linux container (built-in or custom). 

The built-in Linux containers already have the necessary configuration to enable SSH sessions. Linux custom containers require additional configurations to enable SSH sessions. To learn more, see [Enable SSH](configure-custom-container.md?pivots=container-linux#enable-ssh).

SSH sessions through the Azure CLI aren't supported for Windows App Service plans. Only Linux App Service plans are supported.

You can also connect to the container directly from your local development machine by using SSH and SFTP.

## Open SSH session with the Azure CLI

By using TCP tunneling, you can create a network connection between your development machine and Linux containers over an authenticated WebSocket connection. You can then open an SSH session with your container running in App Service from the client of your choice.

To get started, you need to install the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). To see how it works without installing the Azure CLI, open [Azure Cloud Shell](../cloud-shell/overview.md).

Open a remote connection to your app by using the [az webapp create-remote-connection](/cli/azure/webapp#az-webapp-create-remote-connection) command. Specify _\<subscription-id>_, _\<resource-group-name>_, and _\<app-name>_ for your app.

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp create-remote-connection --subscription <subscription-id> --resource-group <resource-group-name> -n <app-name> &
```

> [!TIP]
> `&` at the end of the command is just for convenience if you're using Cloud Shell. It runs the process in the background so that you can run the next command in the same shell.

> [!NOTE]
> If this command fails, make sure [remote debugging](https://medium.com/@auchenberg/introducing-remote-debugging-of-node-js-apps-on-azure-app-service-from-vs-code-in-public-preview-9b8d83a6e1f0) is *disabled* by using the following command:
>
> ```azurecli-interactive
> az webapp config set --resource-group <resource-group-name> -n <app-name> --remote-debugging-enabled=false
> ```

The command output gives you the information you need to open an SSH session.

```output
Verifying if app is running....
App is running. Trying to establish tunnel connection...
Opening tunnel on addr: 127.0.0.1
Opening tunnel on port: <port-output>
SSH is available { username: root, password: Docker! }
Ctrl + C to close
```

Open an SSH session with your container using the client of your choice, through the local port provided in the output (`<port-output>`). For example, with the Linux [ssh](https://ss64.com/bash/ssh.html) command, you can run a single command like `java -version`:

```bash
ssh root@127.0.0.1 -m hmac-sha1 -p <port-output> java -version
```
     
Or, to enter a full SSH session, run:

```bash
ssh root@127.0.0.1 -m hmac-sha1 -p <port-output>
```

When prompted, type `yes` to continue connecting. You're then prompted for the password. Use `Docker!`, which was shown to you earlier.

You're now connected to your connector.  

Try running the [top](https://ss64.com/bash/top.html) command. You should be able to see your app's process in the process list. In the example output, it's the one with `PID 263`.
