# App Service as OpenAPI tool in Microsoft Foundry agent

Empower your existing web apps by exposing their capabilities to Foundry Agent Service using OpenAPI. Many web apps already provide REST APIs, making them ideal candidates for integration into agents that can call REST APIs as tools. By connecting Foundry Agent Service to these APIs, you can rapidly create powerful, feature-rich agents with little code.
