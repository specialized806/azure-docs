# Build agentic web applications

Transform your traditional CRUD web applications for the AI era by adding agentic capabilities with frameworks like Microsoft Semantic Kernel, LangGraph, or Foundry Agent Service. Instead of users navigating forms, textboxes, and dropdowns, you can offer a conversational interface that lets users "talk to an agent" that intelligently performs the same operations your app provides. This approach enables your web app to reason, plan, and take actions on behalf of users.
