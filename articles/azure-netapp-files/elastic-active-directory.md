# Create an Active Directory connection for Azure NetApp Files' Elastic zone-redundant storage

If you're adding SMB volumes to your Elastic zone-redundant capacity pool, you must configure an Active Directory connection. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>For the Flexible, Standard, Premium, and Ultra service levels, follow the instructions in [Create and Manage Active Directory connections](create-active-directory-connections.md).


## Requirements 

* Before creating your Active Directory configuration, you must set up an [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/secrets/about-secrets) containing at least one secret.
    * The key vault must have soft delete and purge protection enabled. To set up a key vault, see the [quickstart guide](/azure/key-vault/general/quick-create-portal).
    * You should store your Active Directory password in the Azure Key Vault then percolate the key vault details and secret name to Azure NetApp Files. 
    * For increased security, select the *Disable public access* option in the network settings for your key vault. You must also select *Allow trusted Microsoft services to bypass this firewall* so that Azure NetApp Files can access the key vault.

## Considerations

* Currently, you can only add one Active Directory account per NetApp subscription. All capacity pools for SMB volumes in a subscription share this Active Directory connection. 
* The Active Directory resource you create for the capacity pool is limited to Elastic zone-redundant storage. The Active Directory resource is available only with capacity pools in Elastic zone-redundant storage. 
* You can't update the resource ID of the Active Directory after it's connected. 
* If you update the password of your Active Directory connection, you should ensure it's also updated in the resource provided. If you don't update the Active Directory, creating SMB volumes can fail. For more information, see [Update the Active Directory connection](#update-the-active-directory-connection).
* Currently, you can only configure Active Directory with a user-assigned identity.  

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Currently, you can create an Active Directory using the Azure portal. Any other CRUD operations must be performed using the REST API. 

## Add a new Active Directory connection 

You can create the Active Directory connection when you [create the capacity pool](elastic-capacity-pool-task.md) or after. These steps outline creating an Active Directory connection after you've created the capacity pool.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to **Capacity pools**. Select the capacity pool you want to create an Active Directory connection for. 

1. In the overview for the capacity pool, select **+ Add Active Directory Connection**. 

1. In the Networking tab, provide inputs for the following fields:

    * **Active Directory policy name**

        Enter a name for the Active Directory configuration. 
    *  **DNS addresses**

        The IP address of the primary DNS server that is required for Active Directory domain join operations, SMB authentication, Kerberos, and LDAP operations. If you use multiple DNS servers, enter the IP addresses as a comma-separated list. 
    * **DNS domain name**

        The fully qualified domain name of the Active Directory used with Azure NetApp Files (for example, `contoso.com`).
    * **Site name**

        This is the Active Directory site name that Azure NetApp Files uses for domain controller discovery.  

    Select **Next**.

1. In the **Identity and access** tab, provide inputs for the following fields:

    * **SMB server prefix**

        The naming prefix for new computer accounts created in Active Directory for Azure NetApp Files SMB, dual protocol, and NFSv4.1 Kerberos volumes. If the naming standard your organization uses for file services is `NAS-01`, `NAS-02`, use `NAS` for the prefix
    * **Organizational unit path**

        The LDAP path for the organizational unit (OU) where SMB server computer accounts will be created. 
    * **Security privilege users**

        This option grants security privilege (`SeSecurityPrivilege`) to Active Directory domain users or groups that require elevated privileges to access Azure NetApp Files volumes.
    * **Administrators**

        This option grants additional security privileges to Active Directory domain users or groups that require elevated privileges to access the Azure NetApp Files volumes.
    * **Backup users**

        This option grants additional security privileges to Active Directory domain users or groups that require elevated backup privileges to support backup, restore, and migration workflows in Azure NetApp Files.
    * **AKV resource**

        Choose the resource identity for your Azure Key Vault. 
    * **User name**
    * **Password secret**
    * **User assigned identity**

        Select the user-assigned identity connected to the Azure Key Vault that you're associating with the account.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/shared/elastic-active-directory-access.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the identity & access management tab." lightbox="./media/shared/elastic-active-directory-access.png":::

1. Optionally, select **Next** to add tags. Otherwise, select the **Review + create** tab to finalize creating the account. 
1. Review your settings then select **Create** to add the Active Directory connection. 

## Add an existing Active Directory connection 

If you've already created an Active Directory connection in the NetApp Elastic account, you can add it to an existing capacity pool. 

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to **Capacity pools**. Select the capacity pool you want to add an Active Directory connection to. 

1. In the overview for the capacity pool, select **+ Add Active Directory Connection**. 

1. Select the Active Directory connection from the dropdown menu. Select **OK** to associate it with the capacity pool. 

## Monitor and modify the Active Directory connection

To check or update the status of the Active Directory connection, you must use the REST API. 

### Check the status of the Active Directory connection 

* To retrieve all the Active Directory configurations for the Azure NetApp Files subscription, use this GET call: 

```rest 
  /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.NetApp/activeDirectoryConfigs​
```

* To retrieve all Active Directory configurations under a resource group, use this GET call: 

```rest
/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.NetApp/activeDirectoryConfigs​
```

* To retrieve information about a specific Active Directory configuration, use this GET call: 

```rest
/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.NetApp/activeDirectoryConfigs/{activeDirectoryConfigName}"​
```

### Update the Active Directory connection 

To update the Active Directory connection of your Elastic zone-redundant account, send a PATCH request: 

```rest
/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.NetApp/activeDirectoryConfigs/​{activeDirectoryConfigName}​
```

The following sample payload can be used to update the Active Directory account password. 

```json
 {
    "location": "region1", ​
    "properties": { ​
        "secretPassword": { ​
            "keyVaultProperties": { ​
                "keyVaultUri": "https://abc-keyvault-uks2.vault.azure.net/", 
               "secretName": "abc" ​
             }​
        }​
    }​
}
```
