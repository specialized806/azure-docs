>[!IMPORTANT]
>If you're using availability zones with custom roles or the built-in Contributor role-based access control (RBAC) role, ensure you have the appropriate permissions set. Not having certain permissions can cause issues in the Azure portal. For configuration details, see [Configure custom RBAC roles](#configure-custom-rbac-roles).
