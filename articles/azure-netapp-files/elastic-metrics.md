# Metrics for Azure NetApp Files' Elastic zone-redundant service level 

Azure NetApp Files provides metrics on allocated storage, actual storage usage, volume I/OPS, and latency. By analyzing these metrics, you can gain a better understanding on the usage pattern and volume performance of your NetApp accounts. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>These metrics are for Elastic zone-redundant service level. For the Flexible, Standard, Premium, and Ultra services levels, see [Azure NetApp Files metrics](azure-netapp-files-metrics.md).

## Usage metrics for capacity pools

- *Volume pool allocated size*
    The provisioned size of the pool.

- *Pool Allocated to Volume Size*  

    The total of volume quota (GiB) in a given capacity pool (that is, the total of the volumes' provisioned sizes in the capacity pool).  
    This size is the size you selected during volume creation.  - *Volume pool total snapshot size*

- *Pool Consumed Size*  
    The total of logical space (GiB) used across volumes in a capacity pool.  

- *Total Snapshot Size for the Pool*    
    The sum of snapshot size from all volumes in the pool.

## Usage metrics for volumes 

- *Percentage Volume Consumed Size*

    The percentage of the volume consumed, including snapshots.  
    Aggregation metrics (for example, min, max) aren't supported for percentage volume consumed size.

- *Volume Allocated Size* 
  
    The provisioned size of a volume

- *Volume Consumed Size*   

    Logical size of the volume (used bytes).  
    This size includes logical space used by active file systems and snapshots. 

- *Volume Snapshot Size*   
 
   The size of all snapshots in a volume.  

## Performance metrics for volumes

> [!NOTE] 
> Volume latency for *Average Read Latency* and *Average Write Latency* is measured within the storage service and doesn't include network latency.

- *Average Read Latency*   
    The average roundtrip time (RTT) for reads from the volume in milliseconds.
- *Average Write Latency*   
    The average roundtrip time (RTT) for writes from the volume in milliseconds.
- *Read IOPS*   
    The number of read operations to the volume per second.
- *Write IOPS*   
    The number of write operations to the volume per second.
- *Other IOPS* 

    The number of [other operations](azure-netapp-files-metrics.md#about-storage-performance-operation-metrics) to the volume per second. 

- *Total IOPS*

    A sum of the write, read, and other operations to the volume per second. 

## Throughput metrics for capacity pools

* *Pool allocated throughput*    
    Sum of the throughput of all the volumes belonging to the pool.
    
* *Provisioned throughput for the pool*   
    Provisioned throughput of this pool.


## Throughput metrics for volumes

* *Read throughput*   

    Read throughput in bytes per second.
    
* *Total throughput*   
    Sum of all throughput in bytes per second.

* *Write throughput*    

    Write throughput in bytes per second.

* *Other throughput*   

    Other throughput (that isn't read or write) in bytes per second.

* *Total throughput*

    Sum of all throughput (read, write, and other) in bytes per second.

## Volume backup metrics 

* *Is Volume Backup Enabled*   

    Shows whether backup is enabled for the volume. `1` is enabled. `0` is disabled.

* *Is Volume Backup Operation Complete*   

    Shows whether the last volume backup or restore operation is successfully completed.  `1` is successful. `0` is unsuccessful.

* *Is Volume Backup Suspended*   

    Shows whether the backup policy is suspended for the volume. A value of  `1` means it's not suspended. A value of `0` means it's suspended.

* *Volume Backup Bytes*   

    The total bytes backed up for this volume.

* *Volume Backup Operation Last Transferred Bytes*   

    Total bytes transferred for last backup operation.

* *Volume Backup Restore Operation Last Transferred Bytes*   

    Total bytes transferred for last backup restore operation.
