# Customer intent: As a cloud architect, I want to map virtual networks between two Azure regions for disaster recovery, so that I can ensure seamless failover and efficient resource allocation during unexpected outages.

# Set up network mapping and IP addressing for VNets

This article describes how to map two instances of Azure virtual networks (VNets) located in different Azure regions, and how to set up IP addressing between networks. Network mapping provides a default behavior for target network selection based on source network at the time of enabling replication.

## Prerequisites

Before you map networks, create [Azure VNets](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md) in the source and target Azure regions.

## Set up network mapping manually (Optional)

>[!NOTE]
> You can now replicate between any two Azure regions around the world. You're no longer limited to enabling replication within your continent.

Map networks as follows:

1. In **Site Recovery Infrastructure**, select **+Network Mapping**.

1. In **Add network mapping**, select the source and target locations. In the following example, the source virtual machine runs in the East Asia region, and replicates to the Southeast Asia region.

1. Create a network mapping in the opposite direction. In the following example, the source is now Southeast Asia, and the target is East Asia.

## Map networks when you enable replication

If you don't prepare network mapping before you configure disaster recovery for Azure virtual machines, you can specify a target network when you [set up and enable replication](azure-to-azure-how-to-enable-replication.md). When you specify a target network, the following actions occur:

- Based on the target you select, Site Recovery automatically creates network mappings from the source to target region, and from the target to source region.
- By default, Site Recovery creates a network in the target region that's identical to the source network. Site Recovery adds **-asr** as a suffix to the name of the target network. You can customize the target network. For example, if the source network name was *contoso-vnet*, then the target network is named *contoso-vnet-asr*.

So, if the source network name was "contoso-vnet", the target network name is `contoso-vnet-asr`. Azure Site Recovery doesn't change the source network name.
- If network mapping already exists for a source network, the mapped target network is always the default when you enable replications for more virtual machines. You can choose to change the target virtual network by choosing other available options from the dropdown.
- To change the default target virtual network for new replications, you need to modify the existing network mapping.
- To modify a network mapping from region A to region B, first delete the network mapping from region B to region A. After reverse mapping deletion, modify the network mapping from region A to region B and then create the relevant reverse mapping.

>[!NOTE]
>* Modifying the network mapping only changes the defaults for new virtual machine replications. It doesn't impact the target virtual network selections for existing replications.
>* To modify the target network for an existing replication, go to **Network** Settings of the replicated item.

## Specify a subnet

The subnet of the target virtual machine is selected based on the name of the subnet of the source virtual machine.

- If a subnet with the same name as the source virtual machine subnet is available in the target network, that subnet is set for the target virtual machine.
- If a subnet with the same name doesn't exist in the target network, the first subnet in the alphabetical order is set as the target subnet.
- You can modify the target subnet in the **Network** settings for the virtual machine.

## Set up IP addressing for target virtual machines

You configure the IP address for each NIC on a target virtual machine as follows:

- **DHCP**: If the NIC of the source virtual machine uses DHCP, the NIC of the target virtual machine also uses DHCP.
- **Static IP address**: If the NIC of the source virtual machine uses a static IP address, the target virtual machine NIC also uses a static IP address.

The same configuration applies to the Secondary IP Configurations.

## IP address assignment during failover

>[!NOTE]
>The following approach assigns an IP address to the target virtual machine, regardless of the NIC settings.

**Source and target subnets** | **Details**
--- | ---
Same address space | The IP address of the source virtual machine NIC becomes the target virtual machine NIC IP address.<br/><br/> If the IP address isn't available, the next available IP address is set as the target.
Different address space | The next available IP address in the target subnet becomes the target virtual machine NIC address.



## IP address assignment during test failover

**Target network** | **Details**
--- | ---
Target network is the failover VNet | - Target IP address is static with the same IP address. <br/><br/>  - If the same IP address is already assigned, the IP address is the next one available at the end of the subnet range. For example, if the source IP address is `10.0.0.19` and failover network uses range `10.0.0.0/24`, the next IP address assigned to the target virtual machine is `10.0.0.254`.
Target network isn't the failover VNet | - Target IP address is static with the same IP address, only if it's available in the target virtual network. <br/><br/>  - If the same IP address is already assigned, the IP address is the next one available at the end of the subnet range.<br/><br/> For example, if the source static IP address is `10.0.0.19` and failover is on a network that isn't the failover network, with the range `10.0.0.0/24`, the target static IP address is `10.0.0.19` if available. Otherwise it is `10.0.0.254`.

- The failover VNet is the target network that you select when you set up disaster recovery.
- Always use a nonproduction network for test failover.
- You can modify the target IP address in the **Network** settings of the virtual machine.
