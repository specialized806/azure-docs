# Manage the configuration server for VMware VM/physical server disaster recovery

You set up an on-premises configuration server when you use [Azure Site Recovery](site-recovery-overview.md) for disaster recovery of VMware virtual machines (VMs) and physical servers to Azure. The configuration server coordinates communications between on-premises VMware and Azure and manages data replication. This article summarizes common tasks for managing the configuration server after it deploys.

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/updated-for-az.md)]

## Update Windows license

The license provided with the Open Virtualization Format (OVF) template is an evaluation license valid for 180 days. For uninterrupted usage, you must activate Windows with a procured license. You can update a license either through a standalone key or a Key Management Services (KMS) standard key. For guidance, see [DISM Windows edition servicing command-line options](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/dism-windows-edition-servicing-command-line-options). To obtain keys, refer to [KMS client setup](/windows-server/get-started/kmsclientkeys).

## Access configuration server

To access the configuration server:

* Sign in to the VM on which it's deployed. Start **Azure Site Recovery Configuration Manager** from the desktop shortcut.
* Alternatively, access the configuration server remotely from `https://*ConfigurationServerName*/:44315/`. Sign in with administrator credentials.

## Modify VMware server settings

1. To associate a different VMware server with the configuration server, after [sign-in](#access-configuration-server), select **Add vCenter Server/vSphere ESXi server**.
1. Enter the details, and then select **OK**.

## Modify credentials for automatic discovery

1. To update the credentials used to connect to the VMware server for automatic discovery of VMware VMs, after [sign-in](#access-configuration-server), choose the account and select **Edit**.
1. Enter the new credentials, and then select **OK**.

    ![Screenshot that shows modifying VMware.](./media/vmware-azure-manage-configuration-server/modify-vmware-server.png)

You can also modify the credentials through `CSPSConfigtool.exe`:

1. Sign in to the configuration server and start `CSPSConfigtool.exe`.
1. Choose the account that you want to modify and select **Edit**.
1. Enter the modified credentials, and then select **OK**.

## Modify credentials for Mobility service installation

Modify the credentials used to automatically install the Mobility service on the VMware VMs that you enable for replication.

1. After [sign-in](#access-configuration-server), select **Manage virtual machine credentials**.
1. Choose the account that you want to modify and select **Edit**.
1. Enter the new credentials, and then select **OK**.

    ![Screenshot that shows modifying Mobility service credentials.](./media/vmware-azure-manage-configuration-server/modify-mobility-credentials.png)

You can also modify credentials through `CSPSConfigtool.exe`:

1. Sign in to the configuration server and start `CSPSConfigtool.exe`.
1. Choose the account that you want to modify and select **Edit**.
1. Enter the new credentials, and then select **OK**.

## Add credentials for Mobility service installation

If you missed adding credentials during OVF deployment of the configuration server:

1. After [sign-in](#access-configuration-server), select **Manage virtual machine credentials**.
1. Select **Add virtual machine credentials**.

    ![Screenshot that shows the Manage virtual machine credentials pane with Add virtual machine credentials.](media/vmware-azure-manage-configuration-server/add-mobility-credentials.png)
1. Enter the new credentials and select **Add**.

You can also add credentials through `CSPSConfigtool.exe`:

1. Sign in to the configuration server and start `CSPSConfigtool.exe`.
1. Select **Add**, enter the new credentials, and select **OK**.

## Modify proxy settings

Modify the proxy settings used by the configuration server machine for internet access to Azure. If you have a process server machine in addition to the default process server running on the configuration server machine, modify the settings on both machines.

1. After [sign-in](#access-configuration-server) to the configuration server, select **Manage connectivity**.
1. Update the proxy values. Then select **Save** to update the settings.

## Add a network adapter

The OVF template deploys the configuration server VM with a single network adapter.

- You can [add another adapter to the VM](vmware-azure-deploy-configuration-server.md#add-an-additional-adapter), but you must add it before you register the configuration server in the vault.
- You can add an adapter after you register the configuration server in the vault. Add the adapter in the VM properties. Then you need to [reregister](#reregister-a-configuration-server-in-the-same-vault) the server in the vault.

## Renew SSL certificates

The configuration server has an inbuilt web server, which orchestrates activities of the mobility agents on all protected machines, inbuilt/scale-out process servers, and master target servers connected to it. The web server uses a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate to authenticate clients. The certificate expires after three years, and you can renew it at any time.

### Check expiry

The expiry date appears under **Configuration Server health**. For configuration server deployments before May 2016, certificate expiry was set to one year. If you have a certificate that's going to expire, the following actions occur:

- When the expiry date is two months or less, the service sends notifications in the portal and by email (if you subscribed to Site Recovery notifications).
- When a notification banner appears on the vault resource page, select the banner for more information.
- If you see **Upgrade Now**, it indicates that some components in your environment must be upgraded to 9.4.xxxx.x or later versions. Upgrade the components before you renew the certificate. You can't renew older versions.

### If certificates are yet to expire

1. To renew, in the vault, open **Site Recovery Infrastructure** > **Configuration Server**. Select the required configuration server.
1. Ensure that all scale-out process servers for components, master target servers, and mobility agents on all protected machines are on the latest versions and in the connected state.
1. Select **Renew Certificates**.
1. Carefully follow the instructions on this page. Select **OK** to renew certificates on the selected configuration server and its associated components.

### If certificates are already expired

1. Post expiry, certificates *can't be renewed from the Azure portal*. Before you proceed, ensure that all scale-out process servers for components, master target servers, and mobility agents on all protected machines are on the latest versions and in the connected state.
1. *Follow this procedure only if certificates are already expired.* Sign in to the configuration server, go to `C:\ProgramData\ASR\home\svsystems\bin`, and run the `RenewCerts` executor tool as an administrator.
1. A PowerShell execution window opens and triggers renewal of certificates. This process can take up to 15 minutes. Don't close the window until renewal is finished.

## Reregister a configuration server in the same vault

You can reregister the configuration server in the same vault if you need to. If you have another process server machine in addition to the default process server running on the configuration server machine, reregister both machines.

1. In the vault, open **Manage** > **Site Recovery Infrastructure** > **Configuration Servers**.
1. On **Servers**, select **Download registration key** to download the vault credentials file.
1. Sign in to the configuration server machine.
1. In `%ProgramData%\ASR\home\svsystems\bin`, open **cspsconfigtool.exe**.
1. On the **Vault Registration** tab, select **Browse**, and locate the vault credentials file that you downloaded.
1. If needed, enter proxy server details. Then select **Register**.
1. Open an admin PowerShell command window, and run the following command:

   ```
    $pwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String MyProxyUserPassword
    Set-OBMachineSetting -ProxyServer http://myproxyserver.domain.com -ProxyPort PortNumber – ProxyUserName domain\username -ProxyPassword $pwd
   ```

    >[!NOTE]
    >To *pull the latest certificates* from the configuration server to the scale-out process server, run the command
    > `"\<Installation Drive\Microsoft Azure Site Recovery\agent\cdpcli.exe>"--registermt`.

1. Restart the `obengine` by running the following command:
   ```
        net stop obengine
        net start obengine
   ```

## Register a configuration server with a different vault

> [!WARNING]
> The following step disassociates the configuration server from the current vault so that the replication of all protected VMs under the configuration server stops.

1. Sign in to the configuration server.
1. Open an admin PowerShell command window, and run the following command:

    ```
    reg delete "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Azure Site Recovery\Registration"
    net stop dra
    ```

1. Use the shortcut on your desktop to start the configuration server appliance browser portal.
1. Perform the registration steps similar to a new configuration server [registration](vmware-azure-tutorial.md#register-the-configuration-server).

## Upgrade the configuration server

You run update rollups to update the configuration server. You can apply updates for up to N-4 versions. For example:

- If you run 9.7, 9.8, 9.9, or 9.10, you can upgrade directly to 9.11.
- If you run 9.6 or earlier and you want to upgrade to 9.11, you must first upgrade to version 9.7 before you can upgrade to 9.11.

For the Site Recovery components support statement, refer to [Service updates in Site Recovery](./service-updates-how-to.md#support-statement-for-azure-site-recovery). Links to update rollups for upgrading to all versions of the configuration server are available in [Service updates in Site Recovery](/azure/site-recovery/service-updates-how-to#updates-support).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> With every new release of a version N of a Site Recovery component, all versions previous to N-4 are considered out of support. We recommend that you upgrade to the latest versions that are available.</br>
> For the Site Recovery components support statement, refer to [Service updates in Site Recovery](./service-updates-how-to.md#support-statement-for-azure-site-recovery).

Upgrade the server:

1. In the vault, go to **Manage** > **Site Recovery Infrastructure** > **Configuration Servers**.
1. If an update is available, a link appears in the **Agent version** column.

    ![Screenshot that shows the update.](./media/vmware-azure-manage-configuration-server/update2.png)
1. Download the update installer file to the configuration server.

    ![Screenshot that shows where to select to download the update installer file.](./media/vmware-azure-manage-configuration-server/update1.png)

1. Double-click to run the installer.
1. The installer detects the current version running on the machine. Select **Yes** to start the upgrade.
1. After the upgrade finishes, the server configuration validates.

    ![Screenshot that shows the completed server validation configuration.](./media/vmware-azure-manage-configuration-server/update3.png)

1. Select **Finish** to close the installer.
1. To upgrade the rest of the Site Recovery components, refer to the [upgrade guidance](./service-updates-how-to.md#vmware-vmphysical-server-disaster-recovery-to-azure).

## Delete or unregister a configuration server

If you replicate VMware VMs or Windows/Linux physical servers to Azure, you can unregister an unconnected configuration server from a vault.

1. [Disable protection](site-recovery-manage-registration-and-protection.md#disable-protection-for-a-vmware-vm-or-physical-server-vmware-to-azure) for all VMs under the configuration server.
1. [Disassociate](vmware-azure-set-up-replication.md#disassociate-or-delete-a-replication-policy) and [delete](vmware-azure-set-up-replication.md#disassociate-or-delete-a-replication-policy) all replication policies from the configuration server.
1. [Delete](vmware-azure-manage-vcenter.md#delete-a-vcenter-server) all vCenter servers/vSphere hosts that are associated with the configuration server.
1. In the vault, open **Site Recovery Infrastructure** > **Configuration Servers**.
1. Select the configuration server that you want to remove. Then, on the **Details** page, select **Delete**.

    ![Screenshot that shows deleting the configuration server.](./media/vmware-azure-manage-configuration-server/delete-configuration-server.png)

### Delete with PowerShell

You can optionally delete the configuration server by using PowerShell.

1. [Install](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell) the Azure PowerShell module.
1. Sign in to your Azure account by using this command:

    `Connect-AzAccount`
1. Select the vault subscription.

     `Get-AzSubscription –SubscriptionName <your subscription name> | Select-AzSubscription`
1.  Set the vault context.

    ```
    $vault = Get-AzRecoveryServicesVault -Name <name of your vault>
    Set-AzRecoveryServicesAsrVaultContext -Vault $vault
    ```
1. Retrieve the configuration server.

    `$fabric =  Get-AzRecoveryServicesAsrFabric -FriendlyName <name of your configuration server>`
1. Delete the configuration server.

    `Remove-AzRecoveryServicesAsrFabric -Fabric $fabric [-Force]`

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the `-Force` option in `Remove-AzRecoveryServicesAsrFabric` for forced deletion of the configuration server.

## Generate configuration server passphrase

1. Sign in to your configuration server, and then open a command prompt window as an administrator.
1. To change the directory to the bin folder, run the command `cd %ProgramData%\ASR\home\svsystems\bin`.
1. To generate the passphrase file, run `genpassphrase.exe -v > MobSvc.passphrase`.
1. Your passphrase is stored in the file located at `%ProgramData%\ASR\home\svsystems\bin\MobSvc.passphrase`.

## Refresh configuration server

1. In the Azure portal, go to **Recovery Services Vault** > **Manage** > **Site Recovery Infrastructure** > **For VMware & Physical machines** > **Configuration Servers**.
1. Select the configuration server that you want to refresh.
1. On the pane with details of the chosen configuration server, select **More** > **Refresh Server**.
1. Monitor the progress of the job under **Recovery Services Vault** > **Monitoring** > **Site Recovery jobs**.

## Failback requirements

During reprotect and failback, the on-premises configuration server must be running and in a connected state. For successful failback, the VM being failed back must exist in the configuration server database.

Ensure that you take regular scheduled backups of your configuration server. If a disaster occurs and the configuration server is lost, you must first restore the configuration server from a backup copy. Ensure that the restored configuration server has the same IP address with which it was registered to the vault. Failback doesn't work if a different IP address is used for the restored configuration server.
