# Azure permissions for Internet of Things

This article lists the permissions for the Azure resource providers in the Internet of Things category. You can use these permissions in your own [Azure custom roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles) to provide granular access control to resources in Azure. Permission strings have the following format: `{Company}.{ProviderName}/{resourceType}/{action}`
