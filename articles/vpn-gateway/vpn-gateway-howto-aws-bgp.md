# How to connect AWS and Azure using a BGP-enabled VPN gateway

This article walks you through the setup of a BGP-enabled connection between Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS). You'll use an Azure VPN gateway with BGP and active-active enabled and an AWS virtual private gateway with two site-to-site connections.

## <a name="architecture"></a>Architecture

In this setup, you create the following resources:

Azure

* One virtual network
* One virtual network gateway with active-active and BGP enabled
* Four local network gateways
* Four site-to-site connections

AWS

* One virtual private cloud (VPC)
* One virtual private gateway
* Two customer gateways
* Two site-to-site connections, each with two tunnels (total of four tunnels)

A site-to-site connection on AWS has two tunnels, each with their own outside IP address and inside IPv4 CIDR (used for BGP APIPA). An active-passive VPN gateway only supports **one** custom BGP APIPA. You'll need to enable **active-active** on your Azure VPN gateway to connect to multiple AWS tunnels.

On the AWS side, you create a customer gateway and site-to-site connection for **each of the two Azure VPN gateway instances** (total of four outgoing tunnels). In Azure, you need to create four local network gateways and four connections to receive these four AWS tunnels.

## <a name="apipa-config"></a>Choosing BGP APIPA addresses

You can use the following values for your BGP APIPA configuration throughout the tutorial.

| **Tunnel** | **Azure Custom Azure APIPA BGP IP Address** | **AWS BGP Peer IP Address** | **AWS Inside IPv4 CIDR** |
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
| **AWS Tunnel 1 to Azure Instance 0** | 169.254.21.2 | 169.254.21.1 | 169.254.21.0/30 |
| **AWS Tunnel 2 to Azure Instance 0** | 169.254.22.2 | 169.254.22.1 | 169.254.22.0/30 |
| **AWS Tunnel 1 to Azure Instance 1** | 169.254.21.6 | 169.254.21.5 | 169.254.21.4/30 |
| **AWS Tunnel 2 to Azure Instance 1** | 169.254.22.6 | 169.254.22.5 | 169.254.22.4/30 |

You can also set up your own custom APIPA addresses. AWS requires a /30 **Inside IPv4 CIDR** in the APIPA range of **169.254.0.0/16** for each tunnel. This CIDR must also be in the Azure-reserved APIPA range for VPN, which is from **169.254.21.0** to **169.254.22.255**. AWS uses the first IP address of your /30 inside CIDR and Azure uses the second. This means you need to reserve space for two IP addresses in your AWS /30 CIDR.

For example, if you set your AWS **Inside IPv4 CIDR** to be **169.254.21.0/30**, AWS uses the BGP IP address **169.254.21.1** and Azure uses the IP address **169.254.21.2**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> * Your APIPA addresses must not overlap between the on-premises VPN devices and all connected Azure VPN gateways.
> * If you choose to configure multiple APIPA BGP peer addresses on the VPN gateway, you must also configure all Connection objects with their corresponding IP address of your choice. If you fail to do so, all connections use the first APIPA IP address in the list no matter how many IPs are present.

## Prerequisites

You must have both an Azure account and AWS account with an active subscription. If you don't already have an Azure subscription, you can activate your [MSDN subscriber benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/) or sign up for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## <a name ="azure-gateway"></a> Create an active-active VPN gateway in Azure

### Create a virtual network

Create a virtual network. You can refer to the [Site-to-site Tutorial](tutorial-site-to-site-portal.md) for steps. For this exercise, we use the following example values:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Subscription** | If you have more than one subscription, verify that you're using the correct one. |
| **Resource group** | TestRG1 |
| **Name** | VNet1 |
| **Location** | East US |
| **IPv4 address space** | 10.1.0.0/16 |
| **Subnet name** | FrontEnd |
| **Subnet address range** | 10.1.0.0/24 |

### Create an active-active VPN gateway with BGP

In this section, you create active-active VPN gateway. You can refer to the [Site-to-site Tutorial](tutorial-site-to-site-portal.md) for steps. When you get to the **Configuration** section of the tutorial, use the following settings to enable BGP and active-active mode. For this exercise, we use the following example values:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Name | VNet1GW |
| Region | East US |
| Gateway type | VPN |
| VPN type | Route-based |
| SKU | VpnGw2AZ |
| Generation | Generation2 |
| Virtual network | VNet1 |
| Gateway subnet address range | 10.1.1.0/24 |
| Public IP address | Create new |
| Public IP address name | VNet1GWpip |
| Availability zone | Zone-redundant |
| Enable active-active mode | Enabled |
| Second public IP address | Create new |
| Public IP address 2 name| VNet1GWpip2 |
| Availability zone | Zone-redundant |

| BGP settings | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Configure BGP | Enabled |
| ASN (Autonomous System Number) | 65000 (example value, must be different than the ASN used by AWS) |
| Custom Azure APIPA BGP IP address | Add two addresses to **Custom Azure APIPA BGP IP address**. Include the IP addresses for **AWS Tunnel 1 to Azure Instance 0** and **AWS Tunnel 2 to Azure Instance 0** from the [APIPA configuration you chose](#apipa-config). The second input will only appear after you add your first APIPA BGP IP address. Example: 169.254.21.2, 169.254.22.2 |
| Second Custom Azure APIPA BGP IP address | Add two addresses to **Second Custom Azure APIPA BGP IP address**. Include the IP addresses for **AWS Tunnel 1 to Azure Instance 1** and **AWS Tunnel 2 to Azure Instance 1** from the [APIPA configuration you chose](#apipa-config). The second input will only appear after you add your first APIPA BGP IP address. Example: 169.254.21.6, 169.254.22.6 |

Creating a gateway can often take 45 minutes or more, depending on the selected gateway SKU. You can see the deployment status on the **Overview** page for your gateway.

To view the public IP addresses that are assigned to your gateway, go to the virtual network gateway portal page **Settings -> Properties**.

## <a name ="connect-aws-gateways"></a> Connect to your AWS customer gateways from Azure

Next, you connect your AWS tunnels to Azure. For each of the four tunnels, you'll have both a local network gateway and a site-to-site connection.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Repeat the following sections for **each of your four AWS tunnels**, using their respective **outside IP address**.

### <a name="create-local-network-gateways"></a> Create local network gateways

Create each local network gateway using the following values. For steps, see [Create a local network gateway](tutorial-site-to-site-portal.md#LocalNetworkGateway). Make sure to use the correct **Outside IP Address** and **BGP Peer IP Address** for each tunnel based on the APIPA configuration you chose, Repeat the steps to create each local network gateway.

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** | Name for your new local network gateway.|
| **Endpoint** | IP Address. |
| **IP Address** | The Outside IP Address for the AWS tunnel you're connecting to (not the BGP Peer IP Address). |
| **Address Space** | Leave blank. |
| **Advanced tab** | Configure BGP settings: **Yes** |
| **Autonomous system number (ASN)** | The ASN for your AWS Virtual Private Network. Use the ASN **64512** if you left your ASN as the AWS default value. |
| **BGP peer IP address** | Enter the AWS BGP Peer IP Address based on the [APIPA configuration you chose](#apipa-config). |

### <a name ="create-azure-connections"></a> Create connections

In this section, you create a site-to-site connection for each of your AWS tunnels. When you create the connection, make sure to select the local network gateway that corresponds to the tunnel you're connecting to and enter the correct BGP Peer IP Address based on the APIPA configuration you chose. For steps, see [Create a connection](tutorial-site-to-site-portal.md#CreateConnection).

Repeat these steps to create each of the required connections.

1. On the **Basics** page, complete the following settings:

   | Basics page | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Connection type** | Site-to-site (IPsec) |
   | **Name** | Enter a name for your connection. Example: AWSTunnel1toAzureInstance0. |

1. On the **Settings** page, complete the following settings:

   | Settings page | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Virtual network gateway** | Select the VPN gateway. |
   | **Local network gateway** | Select the local network gateway you created. |
   | **Shared key (PSK)** | Enter the shared key that matches the preshared key you entered when making the AWS connections. |
   | **Enable BGP** | Select to enable. |
   | **Enable Custom BGP Addresses** | Select to enable. |

1. Under **Custom BGP Addresses**:

   * Enter the Custom BGP Address based on the [APIPA configuration you chose](#apipa-config).
   * The **Custom BGP Address** (Inside IPv4 CIDR in AWS) must match with the **IP Address** (Outside IP Address in AWS) that you specified in the local network gateway you're using for this connection.
   * Only one of the two custom BGP addresses will be used, depending on the tunnel you're specifying it for.
   * When making a connection from AWS to the **first public IP address** of your VPN gateway (instance 0), **only the Primary Custom BGP Address** is used.
   * When making a connection from AWS to the **second public IP address** of your VPN gateway (instance 1), **only the Secondary Custom BGP Address** is used.
   * Leave the other **Custom BGP Address** as default.

   If you used the [default APIPA configuration](#apipa-config), you can use the following addresses:

   | Tunnel | Primary Custom BGP Address | Secondary Custom BGP Address |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | AWS Tunnel 1 to Azure Instance 0 | 169.254.21.2 | Not used (select 169.254.21.6) |
   | AWS Tunnel 2 to Azure Instance 0 | 169.254.22.2 | Not used (select 169.254.21.6) |
   | AWS Tunnel 1 to Azure Instance 1 | Not used (select 169.254.21.2) | 169.254.21.6 |
   | AWS Tunnel 2 to Azure Instance 1 | Not used (select 169.254.21.2) | 169.254.22.6 |

1. Configure the following settings:

   | Setting | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | **FastPath** | Leave the default (deselected). |
   | **IPsec / IKE policy** | Default |
   | **Use policy based traffic selector** | Disable |
   | **DPD timeout in seconds** | Leave the default. |
   | **Connection Mode** | You can select any of the available options (Default, Initiator Only, Responder Only). For more information, see [VPN Gateway settings - connection modes](vpn-gateway-about-vpn-gateway-settings.md#connectionmode). |

1. Save your settings, review your configuration, and create the connection. Repeat these steps to create additional connections.

1. Before continuing to the next section, verify that you have a **local network gateway** and **connection** for **each of your four AWS tunnels**.
