# Monitoring App Configuration
When you have critical applications and business processes relying on Azure resources, you want to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation. 

This article describes the monitoring data generated by App Configuration. App Configuration uses [Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/overview). If you are unfamiliar with the features of Azure Monitor common to all Azure services that use it, read [Monitoring Azure resources with Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource).

## Monitoring overview page in the Azure portal
The **Overview** page in the Azure portal includes a brief view of the resource usage,  such as the total number of requests, number of  throttled requests, and request duration per configuration store. This information is useful, but only displays a small amount of the monitoring data available. Some of this monitoring data is collected automatically and is available for analysis as soon as you create the resource. You can enable additional types of data collection with some configuration.

## Monitoring data 
App Configuration collects the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources that are described in [Monitoring data from Azure resources](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource#monitoring-data). See [Monitoring App Configuration data reference](./monitor-app-configuration-reference.md) for detailed information on the metrics and logs metrics created by App Configuration.

### Understanding Activity Logs and Resource Logs
The Activity log provides insight into subscription-level events and shows management plane activities (create, update, delete operations on your App Configuration resource). However, it doesn't capture data plane operations like key-value reads and writes.

To monitor data plane operations, you need to enable diagnostic settings and route resource logs (audit logs and HTTP request logs) to a destination like Log Analytics workspace. This allows you to see the history of key-value modifications and other operations performed within your App Configuration store.

#### Types of resource logs
App Configuration provides two types of resource logs, reference [Monitoring App Configuration data reference](./monitor-app-configuration-reference.md#resourcelogs):
- **Audit logs**: Capture data plane write operations (create, update, delete) on your key-values. Audit logs don't include data plane read operations but include management plane operations. Logs are not aggregated.
- **HTTP request logs**: Capture both write and read operations on key-values, with operations being aggregated for better performance and reducing log volume. Logs are aggregated based on http method and status code, each log entry may represent multiple similar operations within a certain time window.

## Collection and routing
Platform metrics and the activity log are collected and stored automatically, but can be routed to other locations by using a diagnostic setting.

Resource Logs (including audit logs and HTTP request logs) are not collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting and route them to one or more locations. For example, to view logs and metrics for a configuration store in near real-time in Azure Monitor, collect the resource logs in a Log Analytics workspace. If you do not already have one, create a [Log Analytics Workspace](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/quick-create-workspace) and follow these steps to create and enable a diagnostic setting.

 #### [Portal](#tab/portal)

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.

1. Navigate to your App Configuration store.

1. In the **Monitoring** section, select **Diagnostic settings**, then select **+Add diagnostic setting**. 
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Add a diagnostic setting](./media/diagnostic-settings-add.png)

1. In the **Diagnostic setting** page, enter a name for your setting, then select the log categories you want to collect (such as **HttpRequest** or **Audit**) and choose the destination to send your logs to. Available destinations include Log Analytics workspace, Azure storage account, and Event Hub. We recommend leveraging Log Analytics. To send them to a Log Analytics workspace, choose **Send to Log Analytics workspace**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Details of the diagnostic settings](./media/monitoring-diagnostic-settings-details.png)

1. Enter the name of your **Subscription** and **Log Analytics Workspace**. 
1. Select **Save** and verify that the Diagnostic Settings page now lists your new diagnostic setting. 
    

 ### [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)
    
1. Open the Azure Cloud Shell, or if you've installed the Azure CLI locally, open a command console application such as Windows PowerShell.

1. If your identity is associated with more than one subscription, then set your active subscription to the subscription of the storage account that you want to enable logs for.

    ```Azure CLI
    az account set --subscription <your-subscription-id>
    ```

1. Enable logs by using the az monitor [diagnostic-settings create command](/cli/azure/monitor/diagnostic-settings#az-monitor-diagnostic-settings-create).

    ```Azure CLI
    az monitor diagnostic-settings create --name <setting-name> --workspace <log-analytics-workspace-resource-id> --resource <app-configuration-resource-id> --logs '[{"category": <category name>, "enabled": true "retentionPolicy": {"days": <days>, "enabled": <retention-bool}}]'
    ```

 ### [PowerShell](#tab/PowerShell)
    
1. Open a Windows PowerShell command window, and sign in to your Azure subscription by using the Connect-AzAccount command. Then, follow the on-screen directions.

    ```PowerShell
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```

1. Set your active subscription to the subscription of the App Configuration account that you want to enable logging for.

    ```PowerShell
    Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId <subscription-id>
    ```
    
1. To enable logs for a Log Analytics Workspace, use the [Set-AzDiagnosticSetting PowerShell](/previous-versions/azure/mt631625(v=azure.100)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) cmdlet. 

    ```PowerShell
    Set-AzDiagnosticSetting -ResourceId <app-configuration-resource-id> -WorkspaceId <log-analytics-workspace-resource-id> -Enabled $true -Category HttpRequest,Audit
    ```
1. Verify that your diagnostic setting is correctly set and log categories are enabled. 

    ```PowerShell
    Get-AzureRmDiagnosticSetting -ResourceId <app-configuration-resource-id> 
    ```

For more information on creating a diagnostic setting using the Azure portal, CLI, or PowerShell, see [create a diagnostic setting to collect platform logs and metrics in Azure](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings). 

When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. For further information on the categories of logs for App Configuration, reference [Monitoring App Configuration data reference](./monitor-app-configuration-reference.md#resourcelogs).

### Access control for Log Analytics
To control who can access the Log Analytics workspace to view logs, you need to assign appropriate Azure roles. The following built-in roles provide different levels of access:
- **Log Analytics Reader**: Can view and query all log data
- **Log Analytics Contributor**: Can view and query all log data, as well as perform advanced operations

For detailed information on Log Analytics workspace access control, see [Manage access to Log Analytics workspace data](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/manage-access#built-in-roles).

## Analyzing metrics

You can analyze metrics for App Configuration with metrics from other Azure services using metrics explorer by opening **Metrics** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Analyze metrics with Azure Monitor metrics explorer](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/analyze-metrics) for details on using this tool. For App Configuration, the following metrics are collected: 

* HTTP Incoming Request Count 
* HTTP Incoming Request Duration 
* Throttled HTTP Request Count (HTTP status code 429 Responses)
* Daily Storage Usage
* Request Quota Usage
* Replication Latency
* Snapshot Storage Size

In the portal, navigate to the **Metrics** section and select the **Metric Namespaces** and **Metrics** you want to analyze. This screenshot shows you the metrics view when selecting **Http Incoming Request Count** for your configuration store.

> ![How to use App Config Metrics](./media/monitoring-analyze-metrics.png)

For a list of the platform metrics collected for App Configuration, see [Monitoring App Configuration data reference metrics](./monitor-app-configuration-reference.md#metrics). For reference, you can also see a list of [all resource metrics supported in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported).

## Analyzing logs
Data in Azure Monitor Logs is stored in tables where each table has its own set of unique properties. The common schema is outlined in [Azure Monitor resource log schema](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-schema#top-level-common-schema). 

The [Activity log](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log) is a platform log in Azure that provides insight into subscription-level events. You can view it independently or route it to Azure Monitor Logs, where you can do much more complex queries using Log Analytics.

For a list of the types of resource logs collected for App Configuration, see [Monitoring App Configuration data reference](./monitor-app-configuration-reference.md#resourcelogs). For a list of the tables used by Azure Monitor Logs and queryable by Log Analytics, see [Monitoring App Configuration data reference](./monitor-app-configuration-reference.md#azuremonitorlogstables)

If you have created diagnostic setting for audit logs and HTTP request logs, you can view them in Azure Monitor Logs.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> When you select **Logs** from the App Configuration menu, Log Analytics is opened with the query scope set to the current app configuration resource. This means that log queries will only include data from that resource. 


If you want to run a query that includes data from other configuration or data from other Azure services, select **Logs** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Log query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](/azure/azure-monitor/log-query/scope/) for details.

### Http Request Log
In the portal, navigate to the **Logs** section, and then to the query editor. On the left under the **Tables** tab, select **AACHttpRequest** to see the HTTP request logs of your configuration store. Enter a Kusto query into the editor and results will be displayed below.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Writing kusto queries in our logs](./media/monitoring-writing-queries.png)

Following are sample queries that you can use to help you monitor your App Configuration resource through HTTP request logs. 



* List all HTTP Requests in the last three days 
    ```Kusto
       AACHttpRequest
        | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d)
    ```

* List all throttled requests (returned HTTP status code 429 for too many requests) in the last three days 
    ```Kusto
       AACHttpRequest
        | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d)
        | where StatusCode == "429"
    ```

* List the number of requests sent in the last three days by IP Address 
    ```Kusto
       AACHttpRequest
        | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d)
        | summarize requestCount=sum(HitCount) by ClientIPAddress
        | order by requestCount desc 
    ```

* Create a pie chart of the types of status codes received in the last three days
    ```Kusto
       AACHttpRequest
        | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d)
        | summarize requestCount=sum(HitCount) by StatusCode
        | order by requestCount desc 
        | render piechart 
    ```

* List the number of requests sent by day for the last 14 days
    ```Kusto
    AACHttpRequest
        | where TimeGenerated > ago(14d)
        | extend Day = startofday(TimeGenerated)
        | summarize requestcount=sum(HitCount) by Day
        | order by Day desc  
    ```

### Audit Log
On the left under the **Tables** tab, select **AACAudit** to see the audit logs of your configuration store. Enter a Kusto query into the editor and results will be displayed below.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Audit log](./media/monitoring/monitoring-audit-log.png)

Following are sample queries that you can use to help you monitor your App Configuration resource through audit logs.

* List all Audit Requests in the last three days 
    ```Kusto
    AACAudit
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d)
    ```

### Tracking key-value modifications
For tracking key-value modifications, audit logs are the recommended approach as they specifically focus on these operations. Audit logs provide details including the identity of requestor, caller's ip address, the action taken, and the affected key-value.
HTTP logs can provide additional context about request patterns and performance, such as user agent, request duration, request traffic volume.

* Identify key-value modifications in audit logs in the last 7 days, extracting operation name, resource, the principal identifier (CallerIdentity), source IP address (CallerIPAddress):

    ```Kusto
    AACAudit
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
    | where OperationName in ("set-keyvalue", "delete-keyvalue")
    | project TimeGenerated, OperationName, TargetResource, CallerIdentity, CallerIPAddress, _ResourceId
    | sort by TimeGenerated desc
    ```

* Identify key-value modifications in HTTP request logs in the last 7 days, extracting method, resource, status code, client IP address, user agent:

    ```Kusto
    AACHttpRequest
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
    | where Method in ("PUT", "DELETE")
    | project TimeGenerated, Method, _ResourceId, RequestURI, StatusCode, ClientIPAddress, UserAgent, HitCount
    | sort by TimeGenerated desc
    ```

## Alerts

Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data. They allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. You can set alerts on [metrics](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-metric-overview), [logs](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-unified-log), and the [activity log](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/activity-log-alerts). Different types of alerts have benefits and drawbacks.
The following table lists common and recommended alert rules for App Configuration.

| Alert type | Condition | Description  |
|:---|:---|:---|
|Request quota usage exceeded | RequestQuotaUsage >= 100 | The configuration store has exceeded the [request quota usage](./faq.yml#are-there-any-limits-on-the-number-of-requests-made-to-app-configuration). Upgrade to a standard tier store or follow the [best practices](./howto-best-practices.md#reduce-requests-made-to-app-configuration) to optimize your usage. |
