# Conclude your workload migration from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Azure

This article is part of a series on [how to migrate a workload from AWS to Azure](/azure/migration/migrate-workload-from-aws-introduction). 

Migrating a workload, especially if it's your first workload or if the workload has a lot of dependencies, is an intense project.

By using this guide and the right approach, you can migrate the workload confidently and be prepared to handle issues as they happen. 

The guide covered the items that you'll need for success:

- a concrete and well-thought-out plan
- relevant stakeholders on board
- a solid target architecture
- the right migration strategy for each component of the workload
- a phased approach with clear checklists


> [!TIP] 
> Remember that you can rely on experts. Whenever possible, team up with colleagues or Microsoft experts who have successfully migrated AWS workloads to Azure (for example, Cloud Solution Architects or the Industry Solutions Delivery team). Their experience can help you navigate challenges and adopt best practices.

Migrations require a lot of work, coordination, and cooperation across teams. Often, you need to work late hours to verify everything works as intended. In the end, after a successful migration and decommissioning your AWS workloads, **celebrate your win**!

## Next steps

Now that you completed your workload's migration, learn more about recommendations for post-migration tuning and cost optimization in the [CAF Optimize workloads after migration](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/migrate/optimize-workloads-after-migration) guide.

Keep up to date with Azure, GitHub, and Microsoft development tool changes by monitoring the [Microsoft Developer Changelog](https://developer.microsoft.com/changelog).
