# Conclude your workload migration from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Azure

This article is part of a series about how to [migrate a workload from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Azure](/azure/migration/migrate-workload-from-aws-introduction). 

Workload migration, especially if it's your first migration or if the workload has many dependencies, is an intensive project.

Use this series and the right approach to migrate the workload confidently and prepare to handle problems.

This series covers the following items that you need for success:

- A concrete and well-reasoned plan
- Involvement, alignment, and final approval from the relevant stakeholders
- A solid target architecture
- The right migration strategy for each workload component 
- A phased approach and clear checklists

> [!TIP] 
> Remember that you can rely on experts. When possible, work with colleagues or Microsoft experts who have successfully migrated AWS workloads to Azure. For example, reach out to cloud solutions architects or the Microsoft Industry Solutions Delivery team. Their experience can help you navigate challenges and adopt best practices.

Migration requires effort, coordination, and cooperation across teams. After you successfully migrate and decommission your AWS workload, **celebrate your win**!

To continue improving your environment, review recommendations for post-migration tuning and cost optimization in [Optimize workloads after migration](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/migrate/optimize-workloads-after-migration). Monitor the [Microsoft developer changelog](https://developer.microsoft.com/changelog) to stay up-to-date with Azure, GitHub, and Microsoft development tool changes.
