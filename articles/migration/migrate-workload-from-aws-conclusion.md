# Migrate a workload from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Azure - Conclusion

Migrating a workload, especially if it's your first workload, is an intense project.

With this guide and the right approach, you can execute it smoothly and with confidence. With a concrete and well-thought-out plan, relevant stakeholders on board, a solid target architecture, the right migration strategy for each component of the workload, and a phased approach with clear checklists, you set the stage for success.

Migrations require a lot of work, coordination, and cooperation across teams, often with late hours to verify everything works as intended. In the end, after a successful migration and after decommissioning your AWS workloads, **celebrate your win**!

## Next steps

Now that you've completed your workload's migration, learn more about recommendations for post-migration tuning and cost optimization in the [CAF Optimize workloads after migration](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/migrate/optimize-workloads-after-migration) guide. Consider conducting a [Well-Architected Review](/azure/well-architected/) of your new Azure workload to ensure your workload and your team's practices align with industry best practices.
