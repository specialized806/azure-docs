# Conclude your workload migration from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Azure

Migrating a workload, especially if it's your first workload, is an intense project.

By using this guide and the right approach, you can migrate the workload smoothly and confidently. A concrete and well-thought-out plan, relevant stakeholders on board, a solid target architecture, the right migration strategy for each component of the workload, and a phased approach with clear checklists set the stage for success.

Migrations require a lot of work, coordination, and cooperation across teams. Often, you need to work late hours to verify everything works as intended. In the end, after a successful migration and decommissioning your AWS workloads, **celebrate your win**!

## Next steps

Now that you completed your workload's migration, learn more about recommendations for post-migration tuning and cost optimization in the [CAF Optimize workloads after migration](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/migrate/optimize-workloads-after-migration) guide.

Keep up to date with Azure, GitHub, and Microsoft development tool changes by monitoring the [Microsoft Developer Changelog](https://developer.microsoft.com/changelog).
