# Enable API analysis in your API center - self-managed

This article explains how to enable API analysis in [Azure API Center](overview.md) to set up a linting engine and triggers. These capabilities analyze your API definitions for adherence to organizational style rules, generating both individual and summary reports. API analysis helps identify and correct common errors and inconsistencies in your API definitions.

The following procedures support **automated deployment** of the linting engine and event subscription in your API center. Use the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) for one-step deployment of linting infrastructure for a streamlined deployment process. The Azure CLI command examples can run in PowerShell or a bash shell. Separate command examples are provided, as needed.

If you prefer to set up the engine and resources via **manual deployment**, see the [Azure API Center Analyzer](https://github.com/Azure/APICenter-Analyzer/) GitHub repository for guidance to deploy the function app and configure the event subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure API Center also [automatically configures](enable-managed-api-analysis-linting.md) a default linting engine and dependencies for API analysis. If you enable self-managed analysis as described in this article, you override these built-in features.

## Scenario overview

In this scenario, you analyze API definitions in your API center by using the [Spectral](https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral) open source linting engine. A function app built with Azure Functions runs the linting engine in response to events in your API center. Spectral checks that the APIs defined in a JSON or YAML specification document conform to the rules in a customizable API style guide. An analysis report is generated that you can view in your API center.

The following diagram shows the steps to enable linting and analysis in your API center. 

:::image type="content" source="media/enable-api-analysis-linting/scenario-overview.png" border="false" alt-text="Diagram showing how API linting works in Azure API Center." lightbox="media/enable-api-analysis-linting/scenario-overview.png":::

1. Deploy a function app that runs the Spectral linting engine on an API definition.

1. Configure an event subscription in an Azure API center that triggers the function app.

1. An event is triggered by adding or replacing an API definition in the API center.

1. On receiving the event, the function app invokes the Spectral linting engine.

1. The linting engine checks that the APIs defined in the definition conform to the organization's API style guide and generates a report.

1. View the analysis report in the API center.

### Limitations

* Linting currently supports only JSON or YAML specification files, such as OpenAPI or AsyncAPI specification documents.

* By default, the linting engine uses the built-in [`spectral:oas` ruleset](https://docs.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/4dec24461f3af-open-api-rules). To extend the ruleset or create custom API style guides, see the [Spectral repository](https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral/blob/develop/docs/reference/openapi-rules.md) on GitHub.

* The function app that invokes linting is charged separately, and you manage and maintain it.

## Prerequisites

* An API center in your Azure subscription. To create a subscription, see [Quickstart: Create your API center](set-up-api-center.md).

* The Event Grid resource provider registered in your subscription. If you need to register the Event Grid resource provider, see [Subscribe to events published by a partner with Azure Event Grid](../event-grid/subscribe-to-partner-events.md#register-the-event-grid-resource-provider).

* [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd). Install `azd` on your machine into the environment you plan to use for the following procedure. 

* [Azure Functions Core Tools](/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local). Install the core tools on your machine into the environment you plan to use for the following procedure. Make sure the tools are reachable by your `PATH` settings.

* For Azure CLI:

   [!INCLUDE [install-apic-extension](includes/install-apic-extension.md)]

## Use azd deployment for function app and event subscription

The following procedures provide automated steps for the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) to configure the function app and event subscription that enable linting and analysis in your API center.

> [!NOTE]
> If you prefer to set up the engine and resources with **manual deployment**, see the [Azure API Center Analyzer](https://github.com/Azure/APICenter-Analyzer/) GitHub repository for guidance to deploy the function app and configure the event subscription.

### Run the sample by using azd

1. Clone the sample [Azure API Center Analyzer](https://github.com/Azure/APICenter-Analyzer/) GitHub repository to your local machine.

1. Launch Visual Studio Code, and select **File** > **Open Folder** (**Ctrl**+**K**, **Ctrl**+**O**). Browse to the `APICenter-Analyzer` folder for the cloned repository and choose **Select folder**.

1. In the Visual Studio Code **Activity Bar**, select **Explorer** (**Ctrl**+**Shift**+**E**) so you can view the repository folder structure.

   - Expand the `resources/rulesets` folder and notice the `oas.yaml` file. This file reflects your current API style guide. You can modify this file to satisfy your organizational needs.

   - Expand the `src/functions` folder and notice the `ApiAnalyzerFunction.ts` file. This file provides the function code for the function app. You can modify this file to adjust the function behavior to meet your application requirements.

1. Open a terminal in Visual Studio Code and authenticate with the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`):

   ```azurecli
   azd auth login
   ```

   > [!TIP]
   > You can avoid authentication issues across development environments by running the following commands:
   > 
   > 1. Create a new development environment: `azd env new`
   > 1. Get your tenant ID: `az account show --query tenantId -o tsv` (copy the output ID for later)
   > 1. Sign out: `azd auth logout` command
   > 1. Sign into `azd` with your `tenantId` value from step 2: `azd auth login --tenant-id <tenant_ID>`
   
   When you successfully authenticate, the command output shows you _Logged into Azure as <your_user_alias>_. 

1. Next, sign into the Azure portal by using the Azure CLI:

   ```azurecli
   az login
   ```

   You're prompted to enter your credentials to sign into Azure.
   
   A browser window confirms your successful sign in. Close the window and return to this procedure.

1. Run the following command to deploy the linting infrastructure to your Azure subscription.

   For this command, you need the following information. Most of these values are available on the **Overview** page for your API center resource in the Azure portal.

   - Subscription name and ID
   - API center name
   - Resource group name for the API center
   - Deployment region for the function app (can be different from your API center region)

   ```azurecli
   azd up
   ```

1. Follow the prompts to provide the required deployment information and settings. For more information, see [Running the sample by using the Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://github.com/Azure/APICenter-Analyzer/#wrench-running-the-sample-using-the-azure-developer-cli-azd).

   As the deployment progresses, the output shows the completed provisioning tasks:

   > [!NOTE]
   > It can take several minutes to provision the function app and deploy it to Azure.

1. When the deployment completes, [confirm the new function app is present and the function is published](#confirm-function-published-in-azure-portal).

   If the `apicenter-analyer` function isn't listed or the **Status** isn't **Enabled**, [publish the function](#publish-apicenter-analyzer-function-with-azure-functions-core-tools) by using the Azure Functions Core Tools.

1. [Configure an event subscription](#configure-event-subscription) by using PowerShell or a bash shell in Visual Studio Code.

### Confirm function published in Azure portal

When the deployment completes, confirm the new function app is present in the Azure portal and the function is published.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), browse to the **Function App** section, and select your new function app in the list.

1. On the **Overview** page for the new function app, confirm the function app **Status** is **Running**.

1. In the **Functions** section, confirm the `apicenter-analyer` function is listed and the **Status** is **Enabled**.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/enable-api-analysis-linting/function-app-status.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the function app in the Azure portal showing the Running status and Enabled function.":::

#### Publish apicenter-analyzer function with Azure Functions Core Tools

If the deployment process doesn't publish the `apicenter-analyer` function to the function app in the Azure portal, you can run the following commands in a Visual Studio Code terminal and complete the process.

1. Run the following command to confirm the function isn't published to the function app:

   > [!NOTE]
   > This command uses the [new resource group created by the deployment process](#deployment-resources) for the function app and not the resource group for your API center. Replace `<function-app-name>` and `<new_resource_group_for_function_app>` with your function app name and the name of the resource group for the function app.

   ```azurecli
   az functionapp function list --name <function_app_name> --resource-group <new_resource_group_for_function_app> --query "[].name" -o tsv
   ```

   The command output should be empty.

1. In **Explorer**, expand the `src/functions` folder and open the `ApiAnalyzerFunction.ts` file. This action confirms the environment is set to look for content in the correct location.

1. Confirm your environment includes the npm package manager and node runtime environment, and install any tools as needed:

   ```azurecli
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

1. As needed, install the Azure Functions Code Tools into the environment:

   ```azurecli
   npm install -g azure-functions-core-tools@4 --unsafe-perm true
   ```

1. Run the following command to publish the function code to the function app in the Azure portal. Replace `<function-app-name>` with your function app name.

   ```azurecli
   func azure functionapp publish <function_app_name> --typescript
   ```

   The command shows the following output:

   ```output
   Getting site publishing info...
   [2026-02-26T19:58:38.779Z] Starting the function app deployment...
   Uploading package...
   Uploading 33.8 MB [###############################################################################]
   Upload completed successfully.
   Deployment completed successfully.
   apicenter-analyzer - [eventGridTrigger]
   ```

1. In the Azure portal, confirm the `apicenter-analyer` function is now [published and enabled for your function app](#confirm-function-published-in-azure-portal).

### Configure event subscription

After the function is successfully published to the function app in the Azure portal, you can create an event subscription in your API center to trigger the function app when an API definition file is uploaded or updated.

1. Get the resource ID of your API center. Substitute `<apic-name>` and `<resource-group-name>` with your API center name and the name of the resource group for your API center.

    ```azurecli
    #! /bin/bash
    apicID=$(az apic show --name <apic-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
        --query "id" --output tsv)
    ```

    ```azurecli
    # PowerShell syntax
    $apicID=$(az apic show --name <apic-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> `
        --query "id" --output tsv)
    ```

1. Get the resource ID of the function in the function app. In this example, the function name is *apicenter-analyzer*. Substitute `<function-app-name>` and `<resource-group-name>` with your function app name and the name of the resource group for your function app.

    ```azurecli
    #! /bin/bash
    functionID=$(az functionapp function show --name <function-app-name> \
        --function-name apicenter-analyzer --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
        --query "id" --output tsv)
    ```

    ```azurecli
    # PowerShell syntax
    $functionID=$(az functionapp function show --name <function-app-name> `
        --function-name apicenter-analyzer --resource-group <resource-group-name> `
        --query "id" --output tsv)
    ```

1. Create an event subscription by using the [az eventgrid event-subscription create](/cli/azure/eventgrid/event-subscription#az-eventgrid-event-subscription-create) command. The created subscription includes events for adding or updating API definitions.

    ```azurecli
    #! /bin/bash
    az eventgrid event-subscription create --name MyEventSubscription \
        --source-resource-id "$apicID" --endpoint "$functionID" \
        --endpoint-type azurefunction --included-event-types \
        Microsoft.ApiCenter.ApiDefinitionAdded Microsoft.ApiCenter.ApiDefinitionUpdated
    ```

    ```azurecli
    # PowerShell syntax
    az eventgrid event-subscription create --name MyEventSubscription `
        --source-resource-id "$apicID" --endpoint "$functionID" `
        --endpoint-type azurefunction --included-event-types `
        Microsoft.ApiCenter.ApiDefinitionAdded Microsoft.ApiCenter.ApiDefinitionUpdated
    ```

    The command output shows details of the event subscription. You can also get details by using the [az eventgrid event-subscription show](/cli/azure/eventgrid/event-subscription#az-eventgrid-event-subscription-show) command:

    ```azurecli
    az eventgrid event-subscription show --name MyEventSubscription --source-resource-id "$apicID"
    ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > It can take a short time for the event subscription to propagate to the function app.

1. Browse to your API center in the Azure portal, and confirm the new event subscription under **Events** > **Event Subscriptions**.

## Trigger event in your API center

To test the event subscription, try uploading or updating an API definition file associated with an API version in your API center. For example, upload an OpenAPI or AsyncAPI document. After the event subscription is triggered, the function app invokes the API linting engine to analyze the API definition.

* For detailed steps to add an API, API version, and API definition to your API center, see [Tutorial: Register APIs in your API center](./tutorials/register-apis.md).

* To create an API by uploading an API definition file with the Azure CLI, see [Register API from a specification file](manage-apis-azure-cli.md#register-api-from-a-specification-file---single-step).

To confirm that the event subscription is triggered:

1. Browse to your API center, and select **Events**.

1. Select the **Event Subscriptions** tab and select the event subscription for your function app.

1. Review the metrics to confirm the event subscription is triggered and linting is invoked successfully.

   :::image type="content" source="media/enable-api-analysis-linting/event-subscription-metrics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the metrics for the event subscription in the portal.":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > It might take a few minutes for the metrics to appear.

After the system analyzes the API definition, the linting engine generates a report based on the configured API style guide.

## View API analysis reports

You can view the analysis report for your API definition in the Azure portal. After an API definition is analyzed, the report lists errors, warnings, and information based on the configured API style guide. 

In the portal, you can also view a summary of analysis reports for all API definitions in your API center.

### Analysis report for an API definition

To view the analysis report for an API definition in your API center:

1. In the portal, browse to your API center, expand **Inventory**, and select **Assets**.

1. In the **Asset** list, select the API for which you added or updated an API definition.

1. Select **Versions**, and then expand the row for the API to examine. 

1. Under **Definition**, select the definition name that you uploaded or updated.

1. Select the **Analysis** tab.

   :::image type="content" source="media/enable-api-analysis-linting/analyze-api-definition.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Analysis tab for an API definition in the Azure portal.":::

The **API Analysis Report** opens, and it displays the API definition and errors, warnings, and information based on the configured API style guide. The following screenshot shows an example of an API analysis report.
