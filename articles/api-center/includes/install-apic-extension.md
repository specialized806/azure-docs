> [!NOTE]
> The `az apic` commands require the `apic-extension` Azure CLI extension. The extension can be installed dynamically when you run your first `az apic` command, or you can install the extension manually. For more information, see [Manage Azure CLI Extensions: Install, Update, and Remove](/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).
>
> For the latest changes and updates in the `apic-extension`, see the [release notes](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions/blob/main/src/apic-extension/HISTORY.rst). Certain features might require a preview or specific version of the extension.
