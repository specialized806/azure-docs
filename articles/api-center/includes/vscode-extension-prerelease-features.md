When you install the extension from the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=apidev.azure-api-center&ssr=false#overview), you can choose to install the release version or a prerelease version (as available). To switch between installed versions, select the extension's **Manage** button (gear icon) in the **Extensions** view in Visual Studio Code.
