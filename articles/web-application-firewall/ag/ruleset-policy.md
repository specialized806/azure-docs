# Azure Web Application Firewall managed ruleset support policy

::: zone pivot="application-gateway"

Azure Web Application Firewall supports a defined set of managed ruleset versions to ensure strong security protections, predictable behavior, and a clear upgrade path for customers. Azure manages the Default Rule Set (DRS), selected Core Rule Set (CRS) versions, Bot Management and HTTP DDoS rulesets, and periodically releases new rule set versions that include new protections, updated signatures, and rule improvements.

## Supported versions

Starting February 2026, Azure WAF actively **supports the latest three ruleset releases** in the following format:


- **N:** Latest available rule set version (for example, **DRS 2.2**)

- **N-1:** Previous rule set version (for example, **DRS 2.1**)

::: zone pivot="application-gateway"

- **N-2:** Second previous rule set version (for example, **CRS 3.2**)

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="front-door"

- **N-2:** Second previous rule set version (for example, **DRS 2.0**)

::: zone-end

Only **N, N-1, and N-2 versions** are supported for general use and receive ongoing updates, improvements, and rule tuning from the Azure WAF team.

## Extended support for older rule sets

When a newer rule set version (**N**) is released to general availability, the ruleset that becomes **N-3** will enter a **final support phase**:

::: zone pivot="application-gateway"

- Once the newer ruleset version (N) is released, new Azure WAF policies can't be created with the **N-3** version, and any existing WAF policies with the N-3 version can't be attached.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="front-door"

- Once the newer ruleset version (N) is released, new Azure WAF policies can't be created with the **N-3** version.

::: zone-end

- The **N-3 version continues to be supported for 12 months** from the release date of the new **N** rule set, for existing WAF policies only. During these 12 months period, the N-3 version is eligible to receive **only critical security updates** similarly to the N, N-1 and N-2 versions.

- After the 12-month period, the N-3 version will no longer be supported. It won't receive any further updates, fixes, or support from the support team.

This rolling support window helps ensure that users have ample time to plan and migrate to supported versions while maintaining a clear lifecycle for managed rule sets.

## Upgrade recommendations

Users are encouraged to:

- Use the **latest rule set version (N)** where possible to benefit from the most current protections and rule coverage.

- Plan upgrades early, taking advantage of the **12-month final support period** for older rule sets.

::: zone pivot="application-gateway"

- Review [Upgrade CRS or DRS ruleset version](/azure/web-application-firewall/ag/upgrade-ruleset-version) for breaking changes, added rules, and tuning guidance when moving between major rule set versions.

> [!WARNING]
> Failure to upgrade beyond the final support period might expose applications to unpatched vulnerabilities and reduced managed rule coverage.
