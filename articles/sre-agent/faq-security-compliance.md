This FAQ addresses security, compliance, and data handling questions that enterprise teams ask when evaluating Azure SRE Agent for production use.

## Architecture overview

### What is the high-level architecture?

Azure SRE Agent is a cloud-native AI service with three main layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      Frontend API                            │
│           (REST, WebSocket, Authentication)                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              │
                              ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   Orchestration Layer                        │
│  Agent Runtime  |  Workflow Engine  |  Handoff Manager      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         │                    │                    │
         ▼                    ▼                    ▼
┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐
│  Knowledge  │      │    Tool     │      │      LLM        │

└─────────────┘      └─────────────┘      └─────────────────┘
```

### What data stores does SRE Agent use?

SRE Agent uses several Azure data services:

| Data Type | Storage Service | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Conversation threads | Cosmos DB | Thread and message history |
| User memories | Cosmos DB | Per-user context storage |
| Knowledge documents | Azure Blob Storage + AI Search | Document storage and semantic search |
| Telemetry/traces | Azure Data Explorer (optional) | Investigation traces |
| Workflow state | Durable Task Hub | Long-running workflow state |

## Access control and identity

### How is access controlled?

Azure SRE Agent uses **Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**.

To create an agent, your user account needs `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` permissions, typically through:
- Role Based Access Control Administrator
- User Access Administrator
- Owner

### What identities does SRE Agent use internally?

The agent uses **Managed Identities** for all Azure resource access:

| Component | Identity Type | Access Scope |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Agent Runtime | System-Assigned Managed Identity | Cosmos DB, AI Search, Blob Storage, LLM Provider |
| Tool Execution | System-Assigned Managed Identity | Azure ARM, Log Analytics, Kusto |
| AI Search | User-Assigned Managed Identity | Blob Storage |

No secrets or connection strings are stored in configuration.

### How do I control what resources the agent can access?

You associate specific resource groups with your agent during creation. The agent only has access to resources within those associated resource groups.

RBAC assignments grant minimum required permissions:
- **Log Analytics:** Reader access for queries
- **Azure Resources:** Reader for ARM operations  
- **Storage:** Blob Data Contributor for knowledge base

### What user authentication is used?

Users authenticate via **Azure AD (Entra ID)**. The Frontend API validates tokens and enforces access policies.

## Data handling and storage

### Where is my data stored?

Data is stored in the Azure region where you deploy your agent. The data plane uses:

| Service | Data Stored | Replication |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Cosmos DB | Threads, messages, memories | Configurable (single-region default) |
| Blob Storage | Knowledge documents, files | LRS default (configurable) |
| AI Search | Document indexes, embeddings | Single-region |
| LLM Provider | Prompts/completions (transient) | Regional |

### What data is sent to the LLM?

When you interact with Azure SRE Agent, the following may be sent to the underlying LLM:

| Data Type | Sent to LLM | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| User message | Yes | Your question/request |
| System prompt | Yes | Agent behavior instructions |
| Conversation history | Yes (limited) | Multi-turn context |
| Retrieved knowledge | Yes | RAG context from your docs |
| Tool results | Yes | Output from Azure API calls |

Azure SRE Agent uses enterprise-grade AI services with the following data handling policies:
- Your data is NOT used to train models
- Prompts/completions are NOT stored (unless you opt-in)
- Abuse monitoring may store data up to 30 days (can opt-out)

### What actions can the agent take?

Azure SRE Agent operates in one of two access modes:

| Mode | Capabilities |
|------|-------------|
| **Reader Mode** | Read-only access. The agent can investigate, query logs, and analyze resources but cannot make changes. |
| **Privileged Mode** | Full access. The agent can take remediation actions (restart services, scale resources, etc.) on your resources. |

By default, agents start in **Reader mode**. Upgrading to Privileged mode:
1. Requires connected resource groups
2. Grants write permissions to the agent's managed identity
3. Enables the agent to execute remediation actions
4. All actions are logged with user context

You can downgrade back to Reader mode at any time.

## Network security

### What firewall settings are required?

Add `*.azuresre.ai` to your firewall allowlist. Some networking profiles might block access to this domain by default.

### Can I deploy in a private network?

Yes, Azure SRE Agent supports:

| Capability | Supported |
|------------|----------|
| Private endpoints | Yes (Cosmos DB, AI Search, Storage) |
| VNet integration | Yes (outbound traffic) |
| IP allowlisting | Yes |
| Azure Firewall | Yes (control egress traffic) |
| Internal-only (no public endpoint) | Yes |

### What network paths does the agent use?

| Connection | Path |
|------------|------|
| Agent to Cosmos DB | Azure backbone |
| Agent to AI Search | Azure backbone |
| Agent to LLM Provider | Azure backbone |
| Agent to ARM API | Azure backbone |
| Agent to Log Analytics | Azure backbone |
| Agent to MCP Servers | Customer-defined |

## Compliance and certifications

### What compliance certifications apply?

Azure SRE Agent is built on Azure platform services (Cosmos DB, AI Search, Blob Storage). These underlying services hold compliance certifications, which SRE Agent inherits through its architecture:

| Certification | Status | How Inherited |
|---------------|--------|---------------|
| SOC 1 Type 2 | Yes | Via Azure platform services |
| SOC 2 Type 2 | Yes | Via Azure platform services |
| ISO 27001 | Yes | Via Azure platform services |
| ISO 27017 | Yes | Via Azure platform services |
| ISO 27018 | Yes | Via Azure platform services |
| HIPAA BAA | Contact support | May require configuration |
| FedRAMP High | Contact support | Check current status |
| PCI DSS | Contact support | Customer responsibility |

For authoritative compliance information, see [Azure Compliance Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/compliance/).

### What about GDPR?

Azure SRE Agent supports GDPR compliance:

- **Data residency:** Single-region deployment available
- **Right to erasure:** Delete threads, memories via API
- **Data portability:** Export conversations via API
- **DPA available:** Via Microsoft DPA

## Data retention and deletion

### How long is data retained?

Retention depends on the underlying services:
- **Threads/Messages:** Stored until deleted (configurable TTL in Cosmos DB)
- **Knowledge Documents:** Stored until deleted
- **Application Insights:** 90 days default (configurable)
- **Activity Logs:** 90 days (configurable via diagnostic settings)

### Can I delete my data?

Yes. APIs support:
- Deleting individual threads
- Removing user memories
- Purging knowledge documents

### What happens if Microsoft support needs access?

Microsoft follows standard Azure support procedures. For sensitive access, [Customer Lockbox](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/security/fundamentals/customer-lockbox-overview) provides approval workflows for Microsoft engineer access.

## Audit and monitoring

### What logging and audit capabilities exist?

| Activity | Log Location |
|----------|-------------|
| User authentication | Azure AD Sign-in logs |
| API calls | Azure Activity Log |
| LLM interactions | Application Insights |
| Tool executions | Application Insights traces |
| Approvals | Cosmos DB (queryable via API) |

All logs can be exported to SIEM via Azure Event Hub.

### Is there an approval workflow for sensitive actions?

When in Privileged mode, the agent can execute remediation actions, but:

- All actions are tracked with user context, timestamps, and decision history
- You can configure scheduled tasks, runbooks, and subagents with specific action scopes
- Azure RBAC still limits what the managed identity can access
- You can downgrade to Reader mode at any time to disable all write operations

## Encryption

### What encryption is used?

| Data State | Encryption |
|------------|------------|
| Data at rest | AES-256 |
| Data in transit | TLS 1.3 |
| Database encryption | Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) |
| Storage encryption | Azure Storage Service Encryption (SSE) |
