# Quickstart: Build an MCP Apps using Azure Functions

In this quickstart, you create a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server from a template project by using the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`). This MCP server uses the Azure Functions MCP extension to create [MCP Apps](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2026-01-26-mcp-apps/), which are tools that return rich, interactive user interfaces. You can also use the MCP server extension to [create text-based tools](./scenario-custom-remote-mcp-server.md). 

After running the project locally and verifying your code by using GitHub Copilot, you deploy it to a new serverless function app in Azure Functions that follows current best practices for secure and scalable deployments.

Because the new app runs on the Flex Consumption plan, which follows a _pay-for-what-you-use_ billing model, completing this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account.

## Initialize the project

Use the Azure Developer CLI to create an Azure Functions code project from a template.

1. In Visual Studio Code, open a folder or workspace where you want to create your project.
::: zone-end 
::: zone pivot="programming-language-python,programming-language-typescript" 
1. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> to open the command palette. Search for and run `Azure Developer CLI (azd): init`.

1. When prompted, select **Select a template**.

::: zone-end  
::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"  
2. Run the following command in the Terminal: 

    ```console
    azd init --template remote-mcp-functions-dotnet -e mcpweather-dotnet
    ```

    This command pulls the project files from the [template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/remote-mcp-functions-dotnet) and initializes the project in the current folder. The -e flag sets a name for the current environment. In `azd`, the environment maintains a unique deployment context for your app, and you can define more than one. It's also used in names of the resources you create in Azure.

::: zone pivot="programming-language-typescript"  
4. Search for and select **Remote MCP Functions with TypeScript**.

5. When prompted, enter `mcpweather-ts` as the environment name.

    The command pulls the project files from the [template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/remote-mcp-functions-typescript) and initializes the project in the current folder. In `azd`, the environment maintains a unique deployment context for your app, and you can define more than one. It's also used in the names of the resources you create in Azure.

## Build the MCP Apps UI

The MCP Apps weather tool includes a frontend application that you must build before running the project.
::: zone-end
::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"  

1. In the terminal, go to the UI app folder and build the application:

    ```console
    cd src/McpWeatherApp/app
    npm install
    npm run build
    cd ../
    ```

::: zone-end
::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"  

1. In the terminal, go to the UI app folder and build the application:

    ```console
    cd src/app
    npm install
    npm run build
    cd ..
    ```

1. In the `src` directory, create a virtual environment for running the app:

    ### [Bash](#tab/bash)

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

    ### [cmd](#tab/cmd)

    ```cmd
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

[!INCLUDE [run-locally](../../includes/functions-mcp-run-locally.md)]

## Verify by using GitHub Copilot

The project template includes a `.vscode/mcp.json` file that defines a `local-mcp-function` server pointing to your local MCP endpoint. Use this configuration to verify your code by using GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code:

1. Open the `.vscode/mcp.json` file and select the **Start** button above the `local-mcp-function` configuration.

1. In the Copilot **Chat** window, make sure that the **Agent** mode is selected, select the **Configure tools** icon, and verify that `MCP Server:local-mcp-function` is enabled in the chat.

1. Run this prompt:

    ```copilot-prompt
    What's the weather in Seattle?
    ```

    When prompted to run the tool, select **Allow in this Workspace** so you don't have to keep granting permission. The prompt runs the `GetWeather` tool, which returns weather data. Because this tool declares UI metadata, the MCP host also fetches the UI resource and renders an interactive weather widget in a sandboxed iframe within the chat.

1. When you're done testing, press Ctrl+C to stop the Functions host.

## Review the code (optional)

You can review the code that defines the MCP Apps tools. An MCP Apps tool requires two components:

+ A **tool with UI metadata** that declares a `ui.resourceUri` pointing to a UI resource.
+ A **resource** that serves the bundled HTML/JavaScript at the matching `ui://` URI.
::: zone-end  
::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"
The function code for the MCP Apps weather tool is defined in the `src/McpWeatherApp` folder. The `[McpMetadata]` attribute adds UI metadata to the tool, and the `[McpResourceTrigger]` attribute serves the HTML widget:

:::code language="csharp" source="~/functions-scenarios-custom-mcp-dotnet/src/McpWeatherApp/WeatherFunction.cs" range="48-76" :::

:::code language="csharp" source="~/functions-scenarios-custom-mcp-dotnet/src/McpWeatherApp/WeatherFunction.cs" range="34-46" :::  

The `ToolMetadata` constant declares a `ui.resourceUri` that tells the MCP host to fetch the interactive UI from `ui://weather/index.html` after the tool runs. The `GetWeatherWidget` function serves the bundled HTML file at that URI using `[McpResourceTrigger]`.

You can view the complete project template in the [Azure Functions .NET MCP Server](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/remote-mcp-functions-dotnet) GitHub repository.
::: zone-end  
::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"
The function code for the MCP Apps weather tool is defined in the `src/function_app.py` file. The `metadata` parameter on `@app.mcp_tool()` adds UI metadata to the tool:

:::code language="python" source="~/functions-scenarios-custom-mcp-python/src/function_app.py" range="109-130" :::

The `TOOL_METADATA` constant declares a `ui.resourceUri` that tells the MCP host to fetch the interactive UI from `ui://weather/index.html` after the tool runs. The `@app.mcp_resource_trigger()` method serves the HTML widget. The `get_weather_widget` function serves the bundled HTML file at that URI using `@app.mcp_resource_trigger()`:

:::code language="python" source="~/functions-scenarios-custom-mcp-python/src/function_app.py" range="64-105" :::

You can view the complete project template in the [Azure Functions Python MCP Server](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/remote-mcp-functions-python) GitHub repository.
::: zone-end   
::: zone pivot="programming-language-typescript"
The function code for the MCP Apps weather tool is defined in the `src/functions/weatherMcpApp.ts` file. The `metadata` property on `app.mcpTool()` adds UI metadata to the tool, and `app.mcpResource()` serves the HTML widget:

:::code language="typescript" source="~/functions-scenarios-custom-mcp-typescript/src/functions/weatherMcpApp.ts" range="13-17" :::

:::code language="typescript" source="~/functions-scenarios-custom-mcp-typescript/src/functions/weatherMcpApp.ts" range="54-87" :::

:::code language="typescript" source="~/functions-scenarios-custom-mcp-typescript/src/functions/weatherMcpApp.ts" range="102-110" :::

:::code language="typescript" source="~/functions-scenarios-custom-mcp-typescript/src/functions/weatherMcpApp.ts" range="29-52" :::

:::code language="typescript" source="~/functions-scenarios-custom-mcp-typescript/src/functions/weatherMcpApp.ts" range="89-97" :::

The `TOOL_METADATA` constant declares a `ui.resourceUri` that tells the MCP host to fetch the interactive UI from `ui://weather/index.html` after the tool runs. The `getWeatherWidget` handler serves the bundled HTML file at that URI when registered with `app.mcpResource()`.

You can view the complete project template in the [Azure Functions TypeScript MCP Server](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/remote-mcp-functions-typescript) GitHub repository.

This project is configured to use `azd` to deploy this project to a new function app in a Flex Consumption plan in Azure. The project includes a set of Bicep files that `azd` uses to create a secure deployment to a Flex Consumption plan that follows best practices.

1. In the Terminal, run this `azd env set` command: 

    ```console
    azd env set DEPLOY_SERVICE weather 
    ```

    This command sets the `DEPLOY_SERVICE` variable to provision `weather` app related resources


1. Run the `azd provision` command and supply the required parameters to provision resources: 

    ```console
    azd provision
    ```

   | Parameter | Description |
   | ---- | ---- |
   | _Azure subscription_ | Subscription in which your resources are created. |
   | _Azure location_ | Azure region in which to create the resource group that contains the new Azure resources. Only regions that currently support the Flex Consumption plan are shown. |
   | _vnetEnabled_ | `False` to skip creating virtual network resources, which simplifies the deployment. |
    When prompted, pick your subscription, an Azure region for the resources, and choose `false` to skip creating virtual network resources to simplify the deployment.

1. Run the `azd deploy` command to deploy the `weather` app to Azure:

    ```console
    azd deploy --service weather
    ```
