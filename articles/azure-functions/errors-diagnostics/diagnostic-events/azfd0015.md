# AZFD0015: Timer trigger schedule is not a CRON expression

This event occurs when a timer trigger is configured with a non-CRON schedule expression (such as a `TimeSpan`) on a Consumption plan where the scale controller only supports CRON expressions.

| | Value |

| **Event ID** |AZFD0015|
| **Severity** |Warning|

## Event description

Azure Functions timer triggers support both [CRON expressions][cron] and constant interval expressions (such as `TimeSpan` values like `"00:05:00"`). However, the scale controller used by Consumption plans only understands CRON expressions. When a non-CRON schedule is used on these plans, the timer trigger starts and fires correctly, but the scale controller can't interpret the schedule. This may lead to unexpected scaling behavior.

This warning currently applies to Linux Consumption plans. On Windows Consumption and Flex Consumption plans, non-CRON expressions are blocked entirely and produce a startup error.

## How to resolve the event

Replace your timer trigger's schedule expression with an equivalent CRON expression. CRON expressions can use either 5 fields (minute granularity) or 6 fields (second granularity).

For example, instead of a `TimeSpan` of `"00:05:00"` (every 5 minutes), use the CRON expression `"0 */5 * * * *"` (6-digit) or `"*/5 * * * *"` (5-digit).

For more information on CRON expressions in Azure Functions, see [Timer trigger for Azure Functions][timer-trigger].

## When to suppress the event

This event shouldn't be suppressed. While the timer fires correctly today, the scale controller can't interpret non-CRON schedules, which may result in scaling issues. Migrating to a CRON expression ensures correct behavior.
