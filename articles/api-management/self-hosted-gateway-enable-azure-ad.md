# Use Microsoft Entra authentication for the self-hosted gateway

[!INCLUDE [api-management-availability-premium-dev](../../includes/api-management-availability-premium-dev.md)]

The Azure API Management [self-hosted gateway](self-hosted-gateway-overview.md) needs connectivity with its associated cloud-based API Management instance for reporting status, checking for and applying configuration updates, and sending metrics and events. 

This article shows you how to enable the self-hosted gateway to authenticate to its associated cloud instance by using an [Microsoft Entra ID app](../active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals.md), using a client secret or certificate. With Microsoft Entra authentication, you can configure longer expiry times for secrets and use standard steps to manage and rotate secrets. For other authentication options, see [Self-hosted gateway authentication options](self-hosted-gateway-authentication-options.md). 

## Scenario overview

The self-hosted gateway configuration API can check Azure role-based access control (RBAC) to determine who has permissions to read the gateway configuration. After you create a Microsoft Entra app with those permissions, the self-hosted gateway can authenticate to the API Management instance using the app. 

To enable Microsoft Entra authentication, complete the following steps:
1. Create two custom roles to:
    - Let the configuration API get access to customer's RBAC information
    - Grant permissions to read the self-hosted gateway configuration
1. Grant RBAC access to the API Management instance's managed identity 
1. Create a Microsoft Entra app and grant it access to read the gateway configuration
1. Deploy the gateway with new configuration options

## Prerequisites

- An API Management instance in the Developer or Premium service tier. If needed, complete the following quickstart: [Create an Azure API Management instance](get-started-create-service-instance.md).
- Provision a [gateway resource](api-management-howto-provision-self-hosted-gateway.md) on the instance.
- Enable a [system-assigned managed identity](api-management-howto-use-managed-service-identity.md) on the instance.
- Self-hosted gateway container image version 2.2 or later

### Limitations notes

- Only system-assigned managed identity is supported.

### Assign API Management Gateway Configuration Reader Role

<a name='step-1-register-azure-ad-app'></a>

#### Step 1: Register Microsoft Entra app 

Create a new Microsoft Entra app. For steps, see [Create a Microsoft Entra application and service principal that can access resources](../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md). The Microsoft Entra app is used by the self-hosted gateway to authenticate to the API Management instance.

- Generate a [client secret](../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md#option-3-create-a-new-client-secret) for the app.
- Take note of the following application values for use in the next section when deploying the self-hosted gateway: application (client) ID, directory (tenant) ID, and client secret.

> [!NOTE]
> Instead of using a client secret, you can choose to use a certificate for authentication. For steps to upload a certificate to your Microsoft Entra app, see [Use certificates for Azure AD app authentication](/entra/identity-platform/how-to-add-credentials).

#### Step 2: Assign API Management Gateway Configuration Reader Service Role

[Assign](../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md#assign-a-role-to-the-application) the API Management Gateway Configuration Reader Service Role to the app.

- Scope: The API Management instance (or resource group or subscription in which the app is deployed)
- Role: API Management Gateway Configuration Reader Role
- Assign access to: Microsoft Entra app

## Deploy the self-hosted gateway

Deploy the self-hosted gateway to a containerized environment, such as Kubernetes, adding Microsoft Entra app registration settings. 

#### [YAML](#tab/yaml)

In the following example YAML configuration file, Microsoft Entra app registration settings are added to the `data` element of the gateway's `ConfigMap`. The gateway is named *mygw*.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're following the existing Kubernetes [deployment guidance](how-to-deploy-self-hosted-gateway-kubernetes.md):
> - Make sure to omit the step to store the default authentication key using the `kubectl create secret generic` command. 
> - Substitute the following basic configuration file for the default YAML file that the Azure portal generates for you. The following file adds Microsoft Entra configuration in place of configuration to use an authentication key.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration:
> - `<entra-id-app-id>`: Your Microsoft Entra application (client) ID
> - `<entra-id-tenant-id>`: Your Microsoft Entra tenant ID (directory ID)
> - `<entra-id-client-secret>`: The client secret generated for your Microsoft Entra app
> - `<gateway-id>`: Your self-hosted gateway name
> - `<service-name>.configuration.azure-api.net`: Your API Management configuration endpoint

### Deploy to Kubernetes

Save the YAML configuration to a file (for example, `apim-gateway-entra-id.yaml`) and deploy it to your AKS cluster:

```Console
kubectl apply -f apim-gateway-entra-id.yaml
```

[!INCLUDE [api-management-self-hosted-gateway-kubernetes-services](../../includes/api-management-self-hosted-gateway-kubernetes-services.md)]

#### [Helm](#tab/helm)

You can deploy the self-hosted gateway with Microsoft Entra authentication using a [Helm chart](https://github.com/Azure/api-management-self-hosted-gateway). 

Replace the following values in the the `helm install` command with your actual values:

- `<gateway-name>`: Your Azure API Management instance name
- `<gateway-url>`: The URL of your gateway, in the format `https://<gateway-name>.configuration.azure-api.net`
- `<entra-id-tenant-id>`: Your Microsoft Entra tenant ID (directory ID)
- `<entra-id-app-id>`: The application (client) ID of the registered Microsoft Entra app
- `<entra-id-secret>`: The client secret generated for the Microsoft Entra app

```Console
helm install --name azure-api-management-gateway azure-apim-gateway/azure-api-management-gateway \
             --set gateway.name=='<gateway-name>' \
             --set gateway.configuration.uri='<gateway-url>' \
             --set gateway.auth.type='AzureAdApp' \
             --set gateway.auth.azureAd.tenant.id='<entra-id-tenant-id>' \
             --set gateway.auth.azureAd.app.id='<entra-id-app-id>'
             --set config.service.auth.azureAd.clientSecret='<entra-id-secret>' 
```
