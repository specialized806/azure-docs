# Self-hosted gateway authentication options

The gateway container's [configuration settings](self-hosted-gateway-settings-reference.md) provide the following options for authenticating the connection between the self-hosted gateway and the cloud-based API Management instance's configuration endpoint.

|Option  |Considerations  |
|---------|---------|
| [Microsoft Entra authentication](self-hosted-gateway-enable-azure-ad.md)   | Configure Microsoft Entra apps with client secrets or certificates.<br/><br/>Manage access per app with custom role assignments.<br/><br/>Configure secret expiration times per your organization's policies.<br/><br/>Use standard Microsoft Entra procedures to rotate secrets.        |
| [Microsoft Entra workload identity authentication](self-hosted-gateway-enable-workload-identity.md)   | No secrets or certificates to manage - uses federated identity credentials.<br/><br/>Automatic token rotation with short-lived tokens.<br/><br/>Native integration with Azure Kubernetes Service.        |
| Gateway access token. (Also called an authentication key.)    |  Token expires at least every 30 days and must be renewed.<br/><br/>Backed by a gateway key that can be rotated independently.<br/><br/>Regenerating the gateway key invalidates all access tokens.        |

> [!TIP]
> See [Azure API Management as an Event Grid source](/azure/event-grid/event-schema-api-management) for information about Event Grid events that are generated by a self-hosted gateway when a gateway access token is near expiration or has expired. Use these events to ensure that deployed gateways are always able to authenticate with their associated API Management instance.
