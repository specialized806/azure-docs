Visual Studio Code integrates with [Azure Functions Core tools](../articles/azure-functions/functions-run-local.md) to let you run this project on your local development computer. To start your Functions app locally, press <kbd>F5</kbd> or select the **Run and Debug** icon in the left-hand side Activity bar.

The **Terminal** panel displays the output from Core Tools. Your app starts in the **Terminal** panel, and you can see the names of the functions running locally.
