The legacy (old) VPN Gateway SKUs are:

* Standard
* High Performance

If you use legacy SKUs, consider the following:

* You can configure site-to-site VPN Gateway connections in active-active mode only on the High Performance SKU.
* VPN Gateway doesn't use the Ultra Performance gateway SKU. For information about that SKU, see the [ExpressRoute](../articles/expressroute/expressroute-about-virtual-network-gateways.md) documentation.
