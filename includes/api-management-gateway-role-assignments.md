## Create custom roles

Create the following two [custom roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles) that are assigned in later steps. You can use the permissions listed in the following JSON templates to create the custom roles using the [Azure portal](/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles-portal), [Azure CLI](/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles-cli), [Azure PowerShell](/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles-powershell), or other Azure tools.

When configuring the custom roles, update the [`AssignableScopes`](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-definitions#assignablescopes) property with appropriate scope values for your directory, such as a subscription in which your API Management instance is deployed. 

**API Management Configuration API Access Validator Service Role**

```json
{
  "Description": "Can access RBAC permissions on the API Management resource to authorize requests in Configuration API.",
  "IsCustom": true,
  "Name": "API Management Configuration API Access Validator Service Role",
  "Permissions": [
    {
      "Actions": [
        "Microsoft.Authorization/*/read"
      ],
      "NotActions": [],
      "DataActions": [],
      "NotDataActions": []
    }
  ],
  "NotDataActions": [],
  "AssignableScopes": [
    "/subscriptions/{subscriptionID}"
  ]
}
```

**API Management Gateway Configuration Reader Role**

```json
{
  "Description": "Can read self-hosted gateway configuration from Configuration API",
  "IsCustom": true,
  "Name": "API Management Gateway Configuration Reader Role",
  "Permissions": [
    {
      "Actions": [],
      "NotActions": [],
      "DataActions": [
        "Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/gateways/getConfiguration/action"
      ],
      "NotDataActions": []
    }
  ],
  "NotDataActions": [],
  "AssignableScopes": [
    "/subscriptions/{subscriptionID}"
  ]
}
```
