> [!IMPORTANT]
> - API Management no longer supports subscriptions for tracing or the **Ocp-Apim-Trace** header.
> - To improve API security, tracing can now be enabled at the level of an individual API. Obtain a time-limited token using the API Management REST API. Pass the token in a request to the gateway. For details, see [Enable tracing of an API](../articles/api-management/api-management-howto-api-inspector.md#enable-tracing-for-an-api).
> - Take care when enabling tracing. It can expose sensitive information in the trace data. Ensure that you have appropriate security measures in place to protect the trace data.
