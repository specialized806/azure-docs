> [!IMPORTANT]  
> After 30 September 2028, the option to host your function app on Linux in a Consumption plan is retired. To avoid disruptions, migrate your existing Consumption plan apps that run on Linux to the [Flex Consumption plan](../articles/azure-functions/flex-consumption-plan.md) before that date. Apps running on Windows in a Consumption plan aren't affected by this change.
>
> After 30 September 2025, no new features and no new language stack support are added to the Linux Consumption plan. The last supported language versions for Linux Consumption are: .NET 9, Python 3.12, Node.js 22, PowerShell 7.4, and Java 21. Newer language versions aren't supported for Linux Consumption.
