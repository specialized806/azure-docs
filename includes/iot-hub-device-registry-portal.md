## Additional prerequisites for Azure portal

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- An Azure resource group to organize your IoT hub and related resources. For more information, see [Create a resource group](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal).
- Assigned the [Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/privileged#contributor) role to the **Azure IoT Hub** service at the resource group level. When you select members during the role assignment, search for and select **Azure IoT Hub** from the list of service principals. For more information, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal).

## Overview

Use the Azure portal to create an IoT hub with Azure Device Registry and certificate management integration.

The setup process in this article includes the following steps:

1. Set up your ADR namespace with system-assigned managed identity and assign necessary roles.
1. Create a custom credential policy for your namespace.
1. Create an IoT hub linked to your ADR namespace with a user-assigned managed identity.
1. Create a DPS instance and link it to your ADR namespace.
1. Link your IoT hub to the DPS instance.
1. Sync credential policies from your namespace to your IoT hubs.
1. Create an enrollment group and assign a policy to enable device onboarding.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> During the preview period, IoT Hub with ADR integration and certificate management features enabled on top of IoT Hub are available **free of charge**. Device Provisioning Service (DPS) is billed separately and isn't included in the preview offer. For details on DPS pricing, see [Azure IoT Hub pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/iot-hub/).

## Set up your ADR namespace

In this section, you set up your Azure Device Registry (ADR) namespace, enable managed identities, assign the necessary contributor role, and create a custom credential policy. These steps prepare your environment to securely manage device identities and certificates, and ensure your IoT hub can use ADR for device onboarding and certificate management.

### Create an ADR namespace with system-assigned managed identity

When you create a namespace with a system-assigned managed identity, the process also creates a credential known as root CA and a default policy known as intermediate CA. [Certificate management](../articles/iot-hub/iot-hub-certificate-management-overview.md) uses these credentials and policies to onboard devices to the namespace.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Search for and select **Azure Device Registry**.
1. Select **Namespaces** > **Create**.
1. On the Basics tab, fill in the fields as follows:

    | Property | Value |
    | ----- | ----- |
    | **Subscription** | Select the subscription to use for your ADR namespace. |
    | **Resource group** | Select or create the resource group that you want to use for your IoT hub. |
    |**Name**| Enter a name for your ADR namespace. Your namespace name can only contain lowercase letters and hyphens ('-') in the middle of the name, but not at the beginning or end. For example, the name "msft-namespace" is valid. |
    |**Region**|ADR integration and certificate management functionalities are in **preview** and only available in **certain regions**. See the [supported regions](../articles/iot-hub/iot-hub-what-is-new.md#supported-regions). Select the region, closest to you, where you want your hub to be located.|

    :::image type="content" source="../articles/iot-hub/media/device-registry/iot-hub-namespace-1.png" alt-text="Screen capture that shows how to fill the basics tab for an ADR namespace in the Azure portal.":::

1. Select **Next**.
1. In the **Identity** tab, enable a system-assigned managed identity and a credential resource for your namespace. For more information about how ADR works with managed identities and credential resources, see [What is certificate management](../articles/iot-hub/iot-hub-certificate-management-overview.md).

    - Managed identities allow your namespace to authenticate to Azure services without storing credentials in your code.
    - Credential resources securely store and manage device authentication credentials, such as API keys or certificates, for devices connecting to your namespace. When you enable this feature, you can set policies to control how certificates are issued and managed for your devices.

    :::image type="content" source="../articles/iot-hub/media/device-registry/iot-hub-namespace-2.png" alt-text="Screen capture that shows how to enable a system-assigned managed identity for an ADR namespace in the Azure portal.":::

1. Select **Next**.
1. In the Tags tab, you can optionally **add tags** to organize your ADR namespace. Tags are key-value pairs that help you manage and identify your resources. Use tags to filter and group your resources in the Azure portal.

1. Select **Next**.
1. Review your settings, then select **Create** to create your ADR namespace.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The creation of the namespace with system-assigned managed identity might take up to five minutes.

### Get the principal ID for your namespace

To complete some configuration steps after you create the IoT hub, you need the principal ID for your ADR namespace. This value is used to grant permissions and link resources securely.

1. In the Azure portal, go to the ADR namespace you created.
1. On the **Overview** page, at the top right-hand side, select **JSON view**.
1. Locate the identity section and find the value for `principalId`.
1. Copy the principal ID value to use with role assignments for your IoT hub instance.

### Assign roles to your managed identity

After you create your ADR namespace, grant the required permissions to your user-assigned managed identity. The user-assigned managed identity is used to securely access other Azure resources, such as ADR namespace and DPS. If you don't have a user-assigned managed identity, create one in the Azure portal. For more information, see [Create a user-assigned managed identity in the Azure portal](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/manage-user-assigned-managed-identities-azure-portal).

First grant your user-managed identity the **Azure Device Registry Onboarding** role:

1. In the same **Access control (IAM)** pane for your ADR namespace, select **+ Add** > **Add role assignment** again.
1. In the **Role** field, search for and select **Azure Device Registry Onboarding**. This role allows your managed identity to onboard devices using ADR credential policies.
1. Select **Next**.
1. In **Assign access to**, choose **Managed identity**.
1. Select **Select members**, then choose **User-assigned managed identity**. Search for your identity and select it.
1. Select **Review + assign** to finish. After the assignment propagates, your managed identity will have the necessary onboarding permissions.

Repeat these steps to assign the **Azure Device Registry Contributor** role:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to **Home** > **Azure Device Registry** > select your ADR namespace.
1. In the left pane, select **Access control (IAM)**.
1. Select **+ Add** > **Add role assignment**.
1. In the **Role** field, search for and select **Azure Device Registry Contributor**. This role gives your managed identity the permissions ADR needs for setup and operation.
1. Select **Next**.
1. In **Assign access to**, choose **Managed identity**.
1. Select **Select members**, then choose **User-assigned managed identity**. Search for your identity and select it.
1. Select **Review + assign** to finish. After the assignment propagates, you can select the user-assigned managed identity when you create your IoT hub.

### Create a custom policy for your namespace

Create custom policies within your ADR namespace to define how certificates are issued and managed for your devices. Policies allow you to set parameters such as certificate validity periods and subjects. Editing or disabling a policy isn't supported in public preview.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), search for and select **Azure Device Registry**.
1. Go to the **Namespaces** page.
1. Select your ADR namespace.
1. In the namespace page, under **Namespace resources**, select **Credential policies (Preview)**.

    :::image type="content" source="../articles/iot-hub/media/device-registry/custom-policy.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Device Registry custom policy page in the Azure portal." lightbox="../articles/iot-hub/media/device-registry/custom-policy.png":::

1. Select **Enable credential resource**  to turn on credential policies for your namespace, if they aren't already active.
1. In the **Credential policies** page, select **+ Create** to create a new policy.
1. A pane appears where you can configure the policy settings. In the **Basics** tab, complete the fields as follows:
    
    | Property | Value |    
    | -------- | ----- |
    | **Name** | Enter a unique name for your policy. The name must be between 3 and 50 alphanumeric characters and can include hyphens (`'-'`). |
    | **Validity period (days)** | Enter the number of days the issued certificates are valid. |

1. Select **Next** > **Create**.
1. After it's created, select **Go to resource** and select the namespace.
1. To review the policy, select **Credential policies** to see the policy name and validity period.

## Create an IoT hub in Azure portal

In this section, you create a new IoT hub instance with the ADR namespace and your user-assigned managed identity.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), search for and select **Azure IoT Hub**.

    :::image type="content" source="../articles/iot-hub/media/device-registry/device-provision-link-iot-hub.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to link an IoT hub to the Device Provisioning Service instance in the portal."::: 

1. Select **Save**.
1. Select **Refresh**. You should now see the selected hub under the list of **Linked IoT hubs**.

## Sync policies to IoT hubs

Synchronize a policy you created within your ADR namespace to the IoT hub linked to that namespace. This synchronization enables IoT Hub to trust any devices authenticating with a leaf certificate issued by the policy's issuing CA (ICA).

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to the ADR namespace resource you created earlier.
1. In the left pane, select **Namespace resources** > **Credential policies (Preview)**.
1. In the list, select the credential policy you want to synchronize.
1. At the top, select **Sync all**.
1. Wait for the confirmation message that indicates the synchronization succeeded.

If you select to sync more than one policy, the process syncs policies to their respective IoT hubs. You can't undo a sync operation.

## Create an enrollment group and assign a policy

To provision devices with leaf certificates, you need to create an enrollment group and assign the policy you created within your ADR namespace. The allocation-policy defines the onboarding authentication mechanism DPS uses before issuing a leaf certificate. The default attestation mechanism is a symmetric key.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), search for and select **Device Provisioning Services**.
1. Search for and select the DPS instance you created previously.
1. In the **Settings** menu of your DPS instance, select **Manage enrollments**.
